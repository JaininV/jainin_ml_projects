Delaware is under watch for an elevated risk for fire spread this afternoon due to dry, windy conditions, as a major wildfire burns in southern New Jersey.

Early this morning, a fast-moving wildfire spread to 2,500 acres of land in Ocean County, New Jersey, leading to the mandatory evacuation of 170 homes and other structures in Manchester and Lakehurst. About 75 structures were threatened and more mandatory evacuations were ordered as the morning went on, according to the New Jersey Forest Fire Service.

The fire, dubbed the “Jimmy’s Waterhole Fire,” is burning on U. S. military, state and private property along Route 539 and Horicon Avenue in Manchester, the agency said.

The blaze comes during the peak of wildfire season in New Jersey.

A combination of gusty westerly winds, low relative humidity and dry fine fuels is the cause for the elevated fire risk in both Delaware and New Jersey, according to the National Weather Service (NWS).

This afternoon, minimum relative humidity values will range from 25 percent to 30 percent across the region and winds will be sustained from 10 mph to 15 mph with gusts around 20 mph to 25 mph, which will peak in the mid to late afternoon.

With wildfires having already started across the region yesterday, dry and dead vegetation — including dry grasses, dead leaves and other tree litter — will be at risk of fire spread, reports NWS.
