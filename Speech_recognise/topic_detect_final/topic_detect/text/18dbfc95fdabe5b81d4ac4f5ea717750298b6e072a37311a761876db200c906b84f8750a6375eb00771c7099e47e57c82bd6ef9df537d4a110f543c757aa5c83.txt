The federal government has directed the Comptroller General of the Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS) Isah Jere, to handover to the most senior officer in the Service.

This directive is coming following allegation that the outgoing NIS boss was plotting another tenure extension.

Jere has had his retirement extended from last year to April 24, 2023.

Some officers of the Service had threatened to embark on a protest should the federal government extend the tenure of the Comptroller General again after the ongoing one year extension he was given expires on April 24.

Reacting to the development through a memo issued by the Civil Defense, Correctional, Fire and Immigration Services Board, dated 17th of April, 2023, and addressed the NIS boss, the federal government directed him to “hand over to the most senior Officer Deputy Comptroller General on or before Monday 24th April, 2023, pending Mr. President’s appointment of a substantive Comptroller General of the Service.”

The memo signed by the acting secretary to the Board, Obasi Edozie Edmund, reminded the outgoing CG of his one year tenure extension granted to him in 2022 by the President.

The memo, however, thanked Mr. Jere of his contributions to the NIS and the country at large.
