KING Charles' coronation on May 6, 2023 will be a grand occasion, and to celebrate the special day Buckingham Palace has released a special dish.

Here, we tell you why the coronation quiche was selected and how you can make your own.

The official dish of King Charles' coronation was revealed on April 17, 2023.

The Royals posted the announcement of the coronation quiche, featuring spinach and broad beans, on their Twitter account.

The Royal website described it as: "a deep quiche with a crisp, light pastry case and delicate flavours of spinach, broad beans and fresh tarragon."

The announcement went on to say the recipe is perfect for "a coronation big lunch."

The recipe was created by Mark Flanagan, who is the royal chef.

The reason it was chosen as the coronation dish is because it is good for sharing, can be eaten both hot and cold, suits a number of dietary requirements, can be adapted if others want to do it differently and it is not complicated or costly to make.

The Royal Family's website suggests it can be served with green salad and boiled new potatoes to complete the dish.

To make the quiche, you will need the following ingredients:

* Alternative to the five ingredients above, you can use one 250g block of readymade shortcrust pastry.

* You will also need a 20cm flan tin

Once you've got your ingredients together, you'll need to follow the recipe to make sure that your coronation quiche is perfect.

The instructions are as follows:

* Sieve the flour and salt into a bowl, add the fats and rub together using fingertips until you get a sandy texture, like breadcrumbs (Make sure to wash your hands before doing this)

* Pour the milk into the mixture gradually, and bring the ingredients together in a dough.

* Cover the bowl, put it in the fridge and allow the mixture to rest for 30 to 45 minutes.

* After this, take the bowl back out of the fridge. Lightly flour you work surface and then remove the pastry from the bowl and roll it out a little bit larger than your flan tin.

* Line the flan tin with the pastry, making sure that your don't tear it.

* Then put this back in the fridge for another 30 minutes so it can set.

* Line the pastry case with greaseproof paper, add baking beans and then bake for 15 minutes, before removing both the paper and the baking beans.

* Then reduce the oven temperature to 160C.

* Beat together the eggs, milk, cream, herbs and seasoning.

* Scatter half of the grated cheese into the base, then place the chopped spinach, beans and herbs on top. After this, pour the liquid mixture in.

* If necessary, gently stir the mixture to make sure that it is evenly dispersed in the pastry, but be careful not to damage it.

* Sprinkle the second half of the cheese on top, then place in the oven and bake for 25 minutes.

* Bake until it is set and lightly golden.

The coronation dish for the Queen's coronation in 1953 was known as "Poulet reine Elizabeth" and consisted of a creamy curry sauce and chicken, and was used to fill sandwiches or eaten with a salad.

This became better known as coronation chicken, and remains a popular sandwich filling.

Constance Spry and Rosemary Hume are credited with its creation. Spry and Hume were both principals of Cordon Bleu cookery school in London.

It has been suggested that coronation chicken was inspired by jubilee chicken, a dish prepared for George V's silver jubilee in 1935, although this has never been confirmed.

The recipe for jubilee chicken included mixing chicken with mayonnaise and curry.
