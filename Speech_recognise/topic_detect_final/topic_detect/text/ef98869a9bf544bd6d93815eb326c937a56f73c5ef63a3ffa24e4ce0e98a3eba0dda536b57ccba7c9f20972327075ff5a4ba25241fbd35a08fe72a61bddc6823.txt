Co-op joins Sainsbury’s and Tesco in offering exclusive pricing for its members in a bid to fend off discount rivals.

The retailer said customers could save up to £300 a year on Member Prices which is available in stores and online from today.

Co-op said it would also invest a further £15m in May to lower prices, bringing the total spend into keeping prices down in the last six months to £52m.

The new exclusive pricing initiative is part of the chain’s five-year plan to which it will invest £240m into overhauling its membership scheme to attract an additional one million active customers.

Chief membership and customer officer Kenyatte Nelson said: “Our member prices launch is the first step in Co-op’s new membership journey and we’ll look to evolve further across all of our businesses to ensure that our members get access to the very best prices for food, insurance, legal services and funeralcare.

“In addition to this our members will be first in line to access tickets and a range of other benefits from Co-op Live.

“In making this commitment to our members, we are investing directly into our Co-op future.”
