Gene Autry Trail reopened through the Whitewater Wash in Palm Springs Wednesday morning, even as the often-heavy winds that have battered swaths of the Coachella Valley for over a day continue.

The wash sections of both Gene Autry Trail and North Indian Canyon Drive were closed Tuesday morning because of blowing winds that had gusted to 61 mph at Whitewater and 45 mph at the airport. Indian Canyon remains closed.

By Thursday morning, the winds had mostly died down at the airport but remained relatively strong at Whitewater and other northern parts of the valley, with consistent gusts of between about 45 and 60 mph measured after midnight.

The National Weather Service is forecasting winds of 25 to 35 mph and gusts of up to 50 mph in Whitewater on Wednesday, and says there will likely be patches of blowing dust through the morning. The forecast for the airport calls for similar wind speeds in the morning but says gusts will decrease during the day to around 15 to 20 mph. Areas further to the east are expected to see slower winds that also will decrease during the day. The winds are expected to become negligible by Thursday in much of the Coachella Valley, including most of Palm Springs. However, it will be windier in Whitewater, Desert Hot Springs and other nearby areas, with gusts of up to 25 mph expected through Friday before what is expected to be a hot and relatively wind free weekend throughout the area, with highs in the 90s.
