The Ukrainian Embassy in Israel demanded the cancellation of the European SAMBO Championships which had already started in Haifa. The main reason for this claim was the participation of teams from the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus in the competitions, reports The Eastern Herald.

Moreover, the Ukrainian team does not participate in the European Championship. Probably, the reasons for the cancellation of the championship at the request of the Ukrainian side are biased.

Athletes from 24 European countries came to compete on the tatami. In addition, Russia, Belarus and France, according to the decision of FIAS, participate in the championship under a neutral flag.

The event started today, April 19 and will run for four days. The European Championship is only the first stage or qualifying stage. Next up for the participants will be the World Martial Arts Games to be held in Saudi Arabia in October 2023.

Earlier, the chief rabbi of the Israel Police had advised bringing guns into synagogues. This statement was made after the escalation of the conflict with Lebanon.
