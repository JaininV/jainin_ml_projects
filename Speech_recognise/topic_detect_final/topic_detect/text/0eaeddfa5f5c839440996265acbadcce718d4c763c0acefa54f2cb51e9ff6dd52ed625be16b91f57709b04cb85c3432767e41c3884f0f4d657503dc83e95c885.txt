Nosler’s first(ish) chassis rifle is a heater! This bad boy is called the Carbon Chassis Hunter and it’s a sub-seven-pound carbon fiber lover’s dream.

Heavy contour carbon fiber barrel, carbon forend with integral ARCA rail plus M-LOK, carbon grip, and folding carbon stock. The action is smooooth as butter and it’s one hell of a nice looking rifle.

Get the full rundown on this $5,395 MSRP rifle (which is more than what I paid for my car, but wouldn’t make the first time the value of guns in my car far exceeded the value of my wheels) in the video below . . .
