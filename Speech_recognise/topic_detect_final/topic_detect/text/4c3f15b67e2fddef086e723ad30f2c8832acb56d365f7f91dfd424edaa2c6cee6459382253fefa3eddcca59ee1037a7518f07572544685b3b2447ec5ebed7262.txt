On April 10, 2023, Fred Kozel, beloved husband, father, grandfather and friend to many, left all his pain from Parkinson's behind to be with his Heavenly Father.

Fred was born May 11, 1940, to Anthony and Winnia Kozel in Prague, Oklahoma. He moved to Bakersfield as a child and graduated from Bakersfield High School in 1958. After two years of college, he joined the U. S. Marines. During this time, he started a family and later joined the Local 460 Pipefitters Union for 35 years before retiring.

Fred loved fishing, hunting and the outdoors. In 2000, he and his wife, Jackie moved to Bodfish, California and began a life of retirement, friends, family and church, with a lot of hunting and fishing too! Fred never met a stranger! He will be dearly missed by all! Thank you Divinity Hospice for all the love and care you gave him, helping to comfort him throughout this time.

Fred is survived by his wife, Jackie; children: Mark, Jamie, Toni, Terri and Julie; nine grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.

Viewing is Thursday, April 20, from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. at Lake Isabella Mortuary. Services are at Mountain View Baptist Church, Friday, April 21, at 10 a.m. For more, go to legacy.com/us/obituaries/name/fred-kozel-obituary?id=51603623.
