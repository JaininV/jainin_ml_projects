The faculty and staff who are members of the Chicago State University chapter of the University Professionals of Illinois (CSU UPI, IFT Local 4100) enter Day 8 of their strike today after nearly one year at the bargaining table. They will be joined by lawmakers and labor leaders at a 12 PM rally. (See details below.)

Union members at CSU have been on the picket lines since April 3. The union and administration have held five bargaining sessions since that time.

Another bargaining session is scheduled for this afternoon at 3:30 PM.

Members will picket on CSU campus beginning at 10:30 AM and rally at 12 PM (noon).
