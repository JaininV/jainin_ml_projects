The Monthly Team Challenges allow you to play on a team with other Swagbucks Members where you contribute points to your team by earning SB. You earn the points by doing different activities on their website or app including answering the daily poll, searching on their search engine, playing Swagbucks Live, taking surveys and more. You can see the point-earning activities on the Team Challenge page.

According to the Swagbucks website, "All members who participate and contribute at least 500 points to their team’s total will receive a SB bonus in the form of a SB Swag Up Rebate! Members of the 1st place team will receive a 300 SB Swag Up Rebate, 2nd place will receive a 150 SB Swag Up Rebate, 3rd place will receive a 75 SB Swag Up Rebate, and 4th place will receive a 50 SB Swag Up Rebate. The Swag Up Rebate will be made available on April 17th at 8am PT/11AM ET and expires on May 1st at 11:59PM PST."

* Search online: Each time you need to search for something online, use the Swagbucks search engine on their website (instead of Google). I actually have the Swagbucks toolbar installed on my desktop and it places a search box right on my screen making it super easy to search. Every once in a while, they award SB points just for doing the searches I used to do using Google.

* Take surveys on their website

* Watch videos through their website or multiple mobile apps

* Use their online shopping portal and earn Swagbucks when you shop at participating online stores.

* Enter the regular Swag Codes: Swagbucks posts bonus codes on their Facebook, Twitter and blog pages. Once you get the code, you then copy and paste the code into the Swagbucks Mobile App, their website or in the Swagbutton (that you can download to your computer).
