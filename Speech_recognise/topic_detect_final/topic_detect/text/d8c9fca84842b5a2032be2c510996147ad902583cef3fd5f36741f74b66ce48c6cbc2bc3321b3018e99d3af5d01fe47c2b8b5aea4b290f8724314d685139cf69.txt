HUGUENOT – Several Orange County fire departments have been called out to fight a brush fire in the Town of Deerpark.

The fire was reported late Wednesday morning in Shinhollow Road with some 13 acres involved.

Some two hours after the initial call, additional fire departments were called in to help quell the flames.

Afternoon brush fires also burned New Hampton at County Route 12, 1226 River Road in New Windsor and 765 NY-100 in Yorktown.

Orange County Fire Coordinator Vini Tankasali said particularly in this dry, low humidity weather, be extra careful about outdoors fires.

“Discarding cigarettes properly, smoking devices such as cigarettes, matches – we see a lot of fires caused by that whether people are throwing cigarettes from windows, into leaves, or just trying to put them out in dry brush,” he said. “We do recommend also, people on their properties, especially around houses, that they remove any dried leaves or dried dead vegetation that may be surrounding the houses.”

And Tankasali said people should abide by the state outdoors burn ban which expires on May 14.
