Hargroves Helping Hand Media-Group (919-214-9793), a company that helps small businesses to compete in crowded markets, has launched a new digital awareness service optimized for gyms, personal trainers, physical therapists, chiropractors and coaches, to improve their online visibility and help them to attract local clients.

By creating content in several forms, including blogs, podcasts, slideshows, and streaming videos, Hargroves Helping Hand ensures that information about their clients is available in whatever format their potential customers prefer. Each piece of content includes details about the brand and its services, as well as links back to its main website or landing page.

With a combination of marketing experts and content creators, Hargroves Helping Hand can complete a full set of marketing materials for nearly any business, without requiring input from clients other than their website URL. All the required market research on both the client and their competition is in included in the service.

The strategy is provided as a “done-for-you” solution, and clients will never be asked to write their own blogs, record their own podcasts, or host their own videos. However, to ensure every piece of content meets the strictest quality standards, they will be available for clients to review and suggest changes before they are visible to the public.

The Hargroves Helping Hand strategy uses a “low-hanging fruit” approach to help any business rank highly in the search results, in even the most competitive niches. This technique provides immediate results with specific keyword strings and helps businesses to rank higher for more competitive keywords over time.

Each piece of multimedia can also give the client’s primary website or landing pages a boost, by increasing their “domain authority” with the search engine algorithms. As each new piece of content is added online, with links back to the client’s website, it shows the search algorithms that the company is relevant, trustworthy, and interesting.

A spokesperson explained, “We help you to reach your best clients by crafting meaningful hyper-local ads and media coverage. If there’s a service you offer in a specific location, neighborhood, or region, we help you get seen.”
