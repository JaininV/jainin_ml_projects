Elixirs are everywhere. They are magical moments of joy which buoy us at random, unexpected moments. Their appearance goes unnoticed. Sneaking up on us, we never know where they lurk. Perhaps, that is their charm? Once they bring their gifts, we are left with some morsel of happiness, a Best In Show, a litter of stellar puppies, an invitation to judge at next year’s Westminster Kennel Club, even the news of a big entry for a show chair.

The recipient of the elixir moves through all the attention in a dreamlike state. Reality has yet to penetrate, but who really cares if it does.

The term “elixir” originally referred to potions in the Middle Ages which were capable of changing base metals into gold by the Alchemists of the day. It was thought to be a liquid with the power to cure, improve, or preserve something. Moving to our modern world, the term has also morphed into a noun that refers to remedying all difficulties, physical or not–a cure-all. To be more succinct, an elixir is a boost.

In comparison, performance events like field work, rally, obedience, and scent work, to name a few, are all scored objectively by points and/or time. One offers an opinion, the other a score sheet.
