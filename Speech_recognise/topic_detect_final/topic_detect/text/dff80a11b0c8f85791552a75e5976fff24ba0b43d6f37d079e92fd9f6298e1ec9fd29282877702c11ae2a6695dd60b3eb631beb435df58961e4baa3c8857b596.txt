“We did it actually last year, but just on our premises,” said Sukhpaul Jhooty, treasurer of the Khalsa Diwan Society.   “We did not do the road (parade), but this year we went back to the full celebration. It goes from the temple to Marine Drive to Main Street, then Main to 49th, 49th back to Fraser, then to 57th, and then 57th to Ross and back to the temple.”   Jhooty said normally the celebration draws about 150,000 to 175,000 people, but he wasn’t sure what kind of impact the weather forecast for rain would have.       Thousands braved the cloudy skies on Saturday to participate in the annual Vaisakhi parade in Vancouver.  /   The forecast didn’t deter Rupi Lidder, who came in from Surrey to walk in the parade.   “Today is the day when Sikhism came to this world, that’s what we’re celebrating,” she explained.   “It’s the birth of our religion, Sikhism, 350 years ago.”   “After COVID everyone is looking when it will start again,” said Harjip Singh, who is also from Surrey.   “That’s why I think we are getting even more people today.”

The festival originated in northern India, and the Vancouver and Surrey Vaisakhi parades are among the biggest outside India. The Surrey Vaisakhi festival is April 25.  “It’s a festive season, the harvest time as well,” said Jhooty.         Thousands braved the cloudy skies on Saturday to participate in the annual Vaisakhi parade in Vancouver.  /   Premier David Eby, opposition leader Kevin Falcon and numerous provincial, federal and civic politicians were among the crowd.   Vancouver councillor Pete Fry was among those marching behind the floats.   “I think the community and Vancouverites have really missed this, it’s an amazing celebration,” he said.   “Thousands of people out enjoying food, hospitality and camaraderie. It reflects the real Sikh values of giving.”
