Woolworths has continued phasing out its 15c plastic bags, with stores in New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania running down stock of the reusable bags.

Woolworths has already removed 15c bags from stores across the Australian Capital Territory, Northern Territory, Queensland and Western Australia over the past 12 months as part of the brand’s commitment to stop selling the bags nationwide from June. The removal of the 15c plastic bags is expected to remove over 9,000 tonnes of plastic from circulation annually.

“We’re proud to be the first major supermarket to commit removing these plastic shopping bags from our stores, and this change is an important step towards more sustainable grocery across the country.” Woolworths said in a statement.

“We’re excited to have Victoria, New South Wales and Tasmania complete our national journey to remove the 15-cent plastic shopping bags from all our stores nationwide.”

Woolworths is reminding customers about the upcoming change by putting signs in stores and store carparks, as well as sending emails to customers.

“Having reusable bags on hand has become second nature for many shoppers, and so far we have seen our customer embrace this change,” Woolworths’ statement said.

Woolworths will continue to sell paper shopping bags, which are made from at least 70% recycled paper.
