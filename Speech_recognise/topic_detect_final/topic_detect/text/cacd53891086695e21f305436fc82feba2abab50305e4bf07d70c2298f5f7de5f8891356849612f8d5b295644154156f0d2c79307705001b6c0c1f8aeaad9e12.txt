When I lived in Uganda, I learned a term that was applied to the alumni or old boys and girls of an institution. Such persons could be called “historicals.” So I come to you today as an “historical,” one who has been involved in and commented upon many of the important events of recent Anglican history.

I also come to you as a Professor of Biblical Studies – I studied under Prof. F. F. Bruce – and more particularly I come as an expositor of texts.

The previous speaker has taken you through the litany of events that led to the current crisis in Anglicanism. What I hope to do for you today – especially for you who are not so old – is to examine the key texts that led to the Global Anglican Future Conference in 2008 and the Jerusalem Statement and Declaration that proceeded from it.

The foundational text of all texts is the Bible.

“I believe in God the Father, Creator of heaven and earth.” The spiritual battle of our day is being fought precisely over this first proposition of the Creed, which comes from the first chapters of Scripture:

Genesis 1:27-28 So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them. And God blessed them. And God said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it.”

Genesis 2:24 Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh.

But from the earliest days, there has been a counter-voice, Satan, the Ancient Serpent, saying, “Did God really say?” And as our first parents hearkened to this false voice, sin and death entered the human family, and the spoiled fruit of that sin were disordered sexual desire and broken personalities and families and societies.
