American designer, artist, and blogger Cali DeWitt is teaming up with adidas on a collaborative adidas NMD S1. Together the duo is releasing two pairs of the futuristic running shoe.

The pair features a Primeknit upper coated in a black hue with speckled print trickling down to the midsoles. Stripped rope laces and elastic sock collars offer a technical feel to the shoe, followed by the signature Three Stripe branding on the sides. Cali DeWitt’s signature appears on the tongue in orange, along with an all-black rubber sole unit.

Despite limited release details, the Cali DeWitt x adidas NMD S1 “Black” is expected to release soon at adidas.com and select retailers for $250. Take a look below and hit up our dedicated adidas Release Dates for more updates on everything adidas.
