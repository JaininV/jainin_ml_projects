If there’s one thing that the John Wick franchise thrives on, it’s high-octane action, so it only stands that its spin-offs will continue the tradition. Ballerina, starring Ana de Armas, is set to bring epic fight scenes that are on “another level” to the big screen, with its show counterpart, The Continental, pulling out all the stops to deliver glorious bloodshed.

The first poster for Peacock’s upcoming series teases a highly-anticipated return to the iconic hotel, showing a long streak of blood splashed against an elevator button panel. What’s interesting, though, is the highlighted ninth-floor button, which possibly points to a September release date. While a trailer has yet to be released, the ‘Prepare for check-in’ tagline seems to suggest that its release is on the horizon.

The Continental will serve as a prequel for Ian McShane’s character Winston Scott, played by Colin Woodell here. It offers a peek behind the curtain at how the hotels operate, and the establishment of this particular place where no business could take place. Keanu Reeves won’t be returning as the titular assassin due to the show’s 1970s setting, but it will welcome Mel Gibson as a new character named Cormac.

The Lethal Weapon star is joined by Peter Greene as Young Uncle Charlie, Nhung Kate as Yen, Jessica Allain as Lou, Jeremy Bobb as Mayhew, Adam Shapiro as Lemmy, Sally Garnett as The Concierge, and Katie McGrath as The Adjudicator. Other information, such as story details, remain under wraps, but one thing’s for sure — the overwhelming success of John Wick: Chapter 4 has shown that the thirst for assassin action is far from quenched.
