Jewish Women’s Aid has named an interim chief executive, who is returning for her third stint as the charity’s temporary boss.

Monica Tuohy says she will be “overseeing operations” at JWA until a permanent leader is chosen.

Tuohy was appointed after Alison Rosen departed as JWA’s chief executive after just one month in the job.

Rosen left the charity in April and later accused JWA of trying to “intimidate” her into signing a non-disclosure agreement before departing.

Tuohy has previously worked tackling violence against women and girls at the charities Solace Women’s Aid and Southall Black Sisters, as well as at the male victim and perpetrator agency Respect.

JWA said Tuohy had been supporting its trustees and senior leaders since December 2022.

She said: “It has been wonderful working with the JWA team again and I’m looking forward to overseeing operations until a permanent appointment is made.

“The focus, as always, is providing high-quality support to Jewish women experiencing domestic abuse and sexual violence and engaging the community in our prevention education.”

Caroline Ratner, chair of the charity’s trustees, said: “We are delighted to have Monica back at JWA, working with our excellent senior team to ensure the smooth running of the organisation.”
