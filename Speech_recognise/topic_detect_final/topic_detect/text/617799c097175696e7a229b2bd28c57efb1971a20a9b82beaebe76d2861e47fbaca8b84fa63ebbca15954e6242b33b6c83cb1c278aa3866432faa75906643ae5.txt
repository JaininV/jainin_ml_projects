Forgotten Newcastle United defender Ciaran Clark has opened up about his uncertain future come the end of the season.

The 33-year-old Irishman is out of contract in the summer and last played for the Magpies in January 2022. Having spent the season on loan at Sheffield United, it seems pretty clear that he will not be on Tyneside for the kick-off of the 2023/24 Premier League season.

Clark has made just 11 appearances for the Blades but has enjoyed his time in the Steel City, with the club on course for automatic promotion and a return to the top flight after a two-year absence.

“I’m just concentrating on each game and that’s all I do,” said Clark, as reported by the Newcastle Chronicle.

“I’ve enjoyed my time here, I really have. It’s a good group of lads and the people are top-class.

“Everyone around the building made me feel welcome straight away so obviously I would be, but I’m going to focus on the next couple of games and training. And doing whatever I can, and we can, to see the job through.”

When pressed on what the future might hold, Clark added that he was “not thinking about that yet. I haven’t thought about that at all. I’m just focused on training and seeing this season through and seeing what happens in the summer.”

With Newcastle making rapid improvements this campaign and set for Champions League football next season, it is likely that the Saudi-backed club will make several major signings this summer, with a centre-back rumoured to be amongst the priorities.

Even if a new contract was unexpectedly offered, Clark’s game time would undoubtedly be extremely limited, which is far from ideal as he nears the end of his career.
