Ciego de Ávila, Cuba, Apr 13 (Prensa Latina) The sand on the beaches of the Jardines del Rey tourist destination, on the north coast of this central Cuban province, today preserves its quality, after a scientific study with the use of advanced technologies nuclear.

The professor of Nuclear Physics at the University of Havana, Oscar Díaz, specified that this is the first time that this technology has been used to check the levels of heavy and radioactive metals in the sands of the western, central and eastern beaches of the country.

He stated that the results showed that the levels of materials existing on the beaches of the northern keys of Ciego de Ávila are not harmful to man, nor to the animals that inhabit the environment.

The studies are part of a project that began a few years ago on the black sands of the Bibijagua beach, on the Isla de la Juventud and that is now progressing throughout the national territory, pointed out the specialist in charge of the investigations.

He explained that the idea of the investigation arises due to the presence of radioactive waste in areas close to the coasts of Cuba, which makes it essential to know, as a baseline, the levels of natural radioactivity present on the coasts.

As is known, the sand and coastal dunes serve as a shelter for various marine species, many to protect themselves from their predators or use it to lay their eggs, hence the importance of conserving their natural values.

The beaches are one of the main natural attractions of the Jardines del Rey tourist destination, where there are more than 38 kilometers of coastline with crystalline waters and shallow bottoms in the Coco, Guillermo, Paredón Grande, Antón Chico and Media Luna keys.

Several of these riverbank segments were benefited from the dumping of sand, which improved the natural conditions by expanding bathing areas and recovering the region’s coastal dunes.
