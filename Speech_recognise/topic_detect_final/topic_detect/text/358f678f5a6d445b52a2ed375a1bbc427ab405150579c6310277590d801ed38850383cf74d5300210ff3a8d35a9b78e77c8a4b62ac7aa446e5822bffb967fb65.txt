After finishing their Checkmate World Tour in Bangkok, the girls of the K-pop group ITZY returned to Manila for their WannaBe with Bench fan meeting at the Mall of Asia Arena on 16 April.

As the local clothing brand’s global ambassadors, Yeji, Lia, Ryujin, Chaeryeong and Yuna performed at the show dressed in true-blue Bench style.

The girls opened the show with “Wannabe,” and showed off their artistic side by designing a Bench shirt before playing the “Guess the Tagalog Word” game. They were taught to say random Tagalog words such as “Hay naku,” “Galawang mafia,” “Ako ang mafia,” “Mahal Kita” and “Masarap.”

They also took on the karaoke challenge where their hit songs “Sneakers,” “Not Shy” and “Mafia” were translated to Tagalog.

Filipino Midzys, as ITZY’s fans are called, prepared a special fan video, much to the delight of the K-pop stars.

“Every time we visit the Philippines, we feel the overflowing passion of the Filipino fans as well as the bright energy that they give. We get to recharge and receive the energy that the fans are giving to us,” Lia said in a prior press conference.

“We are already appreciative of our fans locally in Korea. But when we saw our fans in other countries we were shocked. So there a lot of nationalities that appreciate and enjoy our songs, too. It was a strange feeling for us, but we are happy,” Yuna said.
