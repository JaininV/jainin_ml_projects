As you can see from the video, you don’t need much time to complete this project—just an hour or so. (If you have more time and want a more involved process, you may create a DIY reclaimed wood headboard.) Even better, it can enhance your bedroom by adding visual interest. We love how you can choose whichever color you want to create your DIY painted headboard and how it’s easy for even first-time DIYers to make it a success.

Before you begin, round up the necessary materials to make crafting your DIY painted headboard more straightforward.

Here’s what you need:

* Paint (if you have an accent wall in your room, you can match it to this if desired)

* First, find the center of your wall. From there, measure the same distance on each side with your measuring tape.

* Then, grab your string and pencil to create an arch connecting both sides. Using this method ensures it’s even.

* Grab your painter’s tape to keep the straight lines even and ensure your moldings aren’t ruined.

* Then, use a paintbrush or roller to fill in the rest of the arch, and you’re done!
