"The Roundup: No Way Out," the third installment of "The Outlaws" series, will be released in the first half of this year.

Ma Dong-seok, also known by his English name, Don Lee, will reprise his role as police officer Ma Seok-do, whose team cracks down on members of a Japanese yakuza group that commits crimes in Korea.

Actor Lee Joon-hyuk will play the villain and Japanese actor Munetaka Aoki will play a Japanese gangster. Lee Sang-yong will be back in the director's chair following 2022's "The Roundup."

The filming of "Roundup: No Way Out" wrapped up in November, according to ABO Entertainment. "The film is currently in post-production for its release in either late May or early June. It boasts an expanded cinematic universe with more than one villain," it said in a statement.

"The Roundup" became the 13th most-watched film in Korean box office history, topping 12.6 million ticket sales last year. It tells the story of police officer Ma going after a serial killer named Kang Hae-sang (Son Suk-ku) who commits crimes in Vietnam.

The 2017 crime action film "The Outlaws," which revolves around Ma bringing down notorious Chinese gang boss Jang Chen (Yoon Kye-sang), attracted over 6.8 million moviegoers in Korea.
