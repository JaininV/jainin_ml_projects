Fabulous 39m (130ft) luxury yacht SWEET ESCAPE is decked out with everything a charter group could dream of: expansive exterior decks, exciting water toys including slide, deck jacuzzi and so much more.

What better way to explore the crystal clear waters of the Bahamas or the glamour of Florida than onboard this classic motor yacht, refitted with modern conveniences and comforts.  The sun deck is a floating paradise where the on deck jacuzzi is surrounded by comfortable seating and a soft bimini can create shade if the sun is too fierce. The upper deck is the sociable hub with lounge and dining zones, plus from this level the crew will attach the slide and the kids – and adults – can spend the day enjoying the exhilarating activities and toys.

Fine dining is provided courtesy of the on-board chef and guests will want for nothing thanks to the attentive and professional 7-person crew. Whether guests choose to chill out on deck or savour a formal dinner in the dining room, there is space for everyone to relax in the lap of luxury.

The interior and facilities of Christensen motor yacht SWEET ESCAPE have been kept up-to-date thanks to careful maintenance and a series of refits since she was first launched in 1993. She really is the perfect family charter vessel and with accommodation for up to 12 guests in six suites, the whole family are welcome.

The Bahamas and Florida are the hub of the winter charter season, but yachts are available all year round offering exploration of some of the most beautiful and secluded islands in the world. An experienced CharterWorld broker will be happy to help you plan, what will no doubt be, your ultimate vacation and a once in lifetime experience.
