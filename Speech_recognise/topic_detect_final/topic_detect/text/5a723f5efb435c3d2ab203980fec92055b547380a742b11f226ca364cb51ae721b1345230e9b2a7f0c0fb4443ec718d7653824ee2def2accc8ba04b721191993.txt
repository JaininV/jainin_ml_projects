Anthony Callea revealed on Sunday he had major doubts about writing his tell-all autobiography Behind The Voice.

The Australian Idol star, 40, told the Herald SunÂ he found the writing process to be 'confronting' as it forced him to relive painful memories.

'It's definitely been a process. This is actually my life and I'm going to put this out there and it's really quite confronting,' he said.

'This whole process has definitely been a year-long psychology session.'

Anthony's autobiography Behind the Voice was released on April 5 and provides a never-before-seen look at his rise to fame and coming out as gay.

'It brought to the surface things I have put in a vault and haven't thought about for a long time because I needed to not think about them to move forward.'

The pop star, who rose to fame on season two of the competition, revealed he actually auditioned for the first season of the show in 2003, but fled the studio, consumed by anxiety.

That same night, he hid out in a hotel room, terrified as he had left his parents a note revealing that he was gay before he set out for the audition.

'At this point, yes, I knew I was gay, but I couldn't even say the word out loud. I couldn't even look at myself in the mirror and say, "I'm gay." The shame and embarrassment were too much and I hated myself' he writes.

Anthony married actor Tim Campbell in 2014 after seven years of dating.

He confirmed his sexuality in 2007, three years after placing second to Casey Donovan on season two of Australian Idol.

He told fans via his website: 'For some, "coming out" isn't a big issue. For me it was.

'Others say you should just be honest with yourself. Well, that is easier said than done.'
