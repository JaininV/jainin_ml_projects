As described in Delilah Dawson's novel, "Phasma," after getting shipwrecked on the post-apocalyptic wasteland of Parnassos, Hux saw something in a young Phasma, took her with him, and then trained her up to be the formidable Stormtrooper. He used her as a trainer as well, having her compete with Cardinal, another star pupil of the First Order.

Hux underestimated Phasma and she betrayed him to further secure her power and position in the First Order. Not realizing that he didn't have her unwavering loyalty, Brendol Hux didn't realize that Phasma had poisoned him with a rare bug from her home planet. The medical robots were unable to identify the toxin and when they put him in a bacta tank to cure his ailments, he dissolved, leaving little more than organs and a tuft of his hair.

When the truth of Commandant Hux's death reached his son, General Hux, the younger Hux seemed to know all about it and was very uninterested in further details. All that mattered was that it further consolidated his power in the First Order.

How much we'll see of Brendol Hux in "The Mandalorian" or other Mandoverse storytelling remains to be seen, but it's an exciting touchstone to other parts of the "Star Wars" canon that lead directly to the events of the sequel trilogy.

"The Mandalorian" is streaming only on Disney+. The season finale airs next week.
