Can Nitric Oxide be used as a treatment for ED?

Nitric oxide (NO) activates the relaxation of smooth muscle tissue (known as corporal cavernosal), leading to increased blood flow into the penis resulting in an erection. Almost all oral treatments of ED (such as Cialis or Viagra) have focused on increasing the effect of Nitric oxide generated in corporal tissue or increasing the ability of this tissue to generate Nitric oxide.

Although several supplements (e.g., L-citrulline and L-arginine) have been shown to increase levels of nitric oxide in men with erectile dysfunction (ED) however, they were less effective than oral drugs used to treat ED (e.g., Viagra).

Natural Nitric oxide treatment for ED via topical application of compounds that will generate sufficient NO in the corporal tissue to initiate an erection is still a practical option.
