N2 Dance is bringing the musical production “Decades — The Ultimate Escape Room,” to the Hilo Palace Theater, Friday, April 28 at 7 p.m., and Saturday, April 29 at 2 p.m.

The show features a cast of 90 performers ages five to adult, who will be acting, singing,

and dancing — showcasing various styles including hip-hop, jazz, b-boy and hula. The music

and dance styles will span a century starting with the 1920s and ending in the 2020s.

The story of “Decades” follows Suzy and her brother Tommy (played by Olga Arianoff, 13, and

Reef Masaoka, 9,) along with their cousins Shantelle and Brock (played by Jenea Gomez, 14,

and Garret De Soto, 13.) The group happens upon an old run-down shack while they are hiking

in the forest. The shack has a worn-out sign on it that reads, “Escape Room.” They decide to

explore and, after getting themselves locked in, travel through time looking for hidden clues to

try to make it back home.

“My favorite part of this show is seeing these dancers have so much fun learning the different

styles of dance from previous decades,” says N2 Dance director Angela Woods.

Explains actor, singer and dancer Reef Masaoka, who attends Ha‘aheo Elementary School and plays little brother Tommy, “I feel like the part of Tommy was written for me. He’s adventurous,

confident and just a little bit of a trouble-maker — yup! That’s me!”

Pre-sale tickets can be purchased for $15/General and $20/Preferred at HiloPalace.com. Keiki

under 3 on lap are free. Tickets will be $5 more at the door.
