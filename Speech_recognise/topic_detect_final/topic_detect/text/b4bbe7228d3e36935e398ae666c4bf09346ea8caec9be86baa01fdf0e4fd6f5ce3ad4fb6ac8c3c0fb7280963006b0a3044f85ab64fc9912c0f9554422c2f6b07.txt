After watching the 2009 horror movie Splice on Netflix, people were “traumatized” and squirmed in their seats afterward.

The movie originally came out in 2010, and it’s about a young scientist couple named Elsa and Clive who work on splicing animal genes and try to add human DNA to their work.

After some success, the scientific group the couple works for tells Sarah Polley and Adrien Brody to stop their experiment.

But the two decided to keep working on their project in secret, and soon they made a female creature with an odd look.

Scientists are shocked by how much faster the creature ages than people. It has a tail, wings, and hands with three fingers.

Elsa grows attached to her experiment, which also grows mentally like a human child. She and her partner decide to give it the name Dren and become its parents by default.

But later in the scary movie, Dren is moved to a farm in the middle of nowhere, where they quickly get bored and decide to cause trouble.

After watching the 14-year-old movie, which was just added to the streaming service last month, many people went on social media to talk about how awe-struck they were.

Just watched Splice, I am disturbed for life.

So they put Splice on Canadian Netflix and idk why they decided to let that traumatic a** movie available for all.

Another scary movie on the streaming giant, Huesera: The Bone Woman, made many people feel like they couldn’t “breathe” after watching it.

In the Mexican movie, actress Natalia Solián plays a woman named Valeria who has always wanted to be a mother. But when she gets pregnant, her dream of being a mother quickly turns into a nightmare because of a curse from a supernatural being.

The trailer shows that when she finds out about her new baby, she tells an older woman that she is “delighted,” but that woman tells her, “Funny, you’re not a kid person.” She is then seen cracking her back and knuckles over and over again.

As the danger gets closer, the pregnant woman is pushed further into a scary world of dark magic that wants to kill her. A woman’s voice tells her:

What is happening to you is quite normal. When you become a mother, you feel like you are split in two. And wait for labor time. You literally feel like your bones are breaking.

Several shocked people shared their thoughts on social media. One person wrote:
