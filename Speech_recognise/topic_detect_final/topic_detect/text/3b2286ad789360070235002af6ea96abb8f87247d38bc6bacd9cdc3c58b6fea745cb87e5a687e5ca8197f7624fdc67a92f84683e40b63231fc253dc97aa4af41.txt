Innovation is incredibly rare. It mostly happens by accident, not by intention.

Work is mostly mundane. It's mostly maintenance. It's mostly local improvement and iteration. Work is mostly . . . work.

But it can absolutely be fulfilling. And you can be excited about that. Being happy at work is about finding challenge, reward, growth, and creative and intellectual stimulation in everything else.
