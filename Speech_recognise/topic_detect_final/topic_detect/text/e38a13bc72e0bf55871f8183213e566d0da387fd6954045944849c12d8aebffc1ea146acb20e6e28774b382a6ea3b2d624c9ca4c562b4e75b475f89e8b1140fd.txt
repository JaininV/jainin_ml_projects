We’re thrilled to announce that Dr James Jiang has been appointed editor of the Sydney Review of Books.

James is a scholar, critic and editor. Many readers will be familiar with James’ critical verve, having read his essays on poetry, criticism and literary history on the SRB and elsewhere.  He will bring tremendous intellectual energy to the SRB, as well as a deep knowledge of Australian literature in all its forms and a commitment to critical rigour. He’s also worked as an editor with the Australian Book Review, Griffith Review and Cordite, and his critical essays on Australian and international literature have appeared in journals and magazines in Australia and around the world.

He’ll step into the role in mid-May.
