Next week, John Mulaney is coming out with his first special in 5 years. Granted, it’s been a busy 5 years for Mulaney. And now, we’ve got a look at a teaser for the special, which doesn’t tell us much other than how confessional this special will be.

In the new special, which is a slight departure from Mulaney’s standard hour, Mulaney talks a lot about his rehab stint and his star-studded intervention. He also talks about being a new father.
