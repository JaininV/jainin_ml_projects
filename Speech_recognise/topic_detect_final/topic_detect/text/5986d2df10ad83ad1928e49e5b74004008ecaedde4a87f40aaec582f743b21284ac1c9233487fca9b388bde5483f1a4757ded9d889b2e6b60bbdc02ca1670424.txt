Barrow were among seven clubs who voted against the IMG proposals today to introduce a grading system to rugby league.

Whitehaven did not attend the meeting at the John Smith’s Stadium in Huddersfield so were declared to have abstained and it was not clear how Workington Town voted having admitted to certain misgivings.

However the vote in favour of the grading system was passed with an overwhelming majority of 86%.

Only Keighley offered initial resistance to the new system, particularly the removal of automatic promotion and relegation. By today they had been joined by Batley and current Championship leaders Featherstone, and Barrow, from the Championship.

Hunslet, Dewsbury and West Wales (who were allowed a vote despite resigning before the season) voted against and there was one abstention from League One.

One Super League club, believed to have been Salford, abstained while Catalans were not permitted a vote due to them not being RFL Council members.

Seven community representatives also voted in favour and RFL chairman Simon Johnson said: ”Our clubs were unanimous in supporting the 12-year strategic partnership with IMG when it was proposed in 2022.

“They have now given strong support for the club grading recommendation which is crucial in allowing the sport to grow and fulfil its potential.”
