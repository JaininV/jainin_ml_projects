Stayntouch, a global leader in cloud hotel property management systems (PMS) and guest-centric technologies, today announced the launch of its Ambassador Program, a new rewards program that incentivizes hotel professionals and consultants who join the movement to empower hoteliers with better technology.

The hospitality industry is undergoing a period of dramatic change. Legacy on-site PMS platforms are clunky, inefficient, difficult to learn, and restrict the ability of hotel staff to deliver a more engaging guest experience. Fortunately, advances in modern cloud and mobile technology are revolutionizing hospitality, helping hotels boost productivity, dramatically cut training time, increase revenue, and elevate service.

The Stayntouch Ambassador Program provides a vehicle for partners to refer their network of hotel owners and operators to Stayntouch and introduce them to the hospitality industry’s most intuitive cloud PMS and technology suite, helping them transform operations, increase their bottom line, and reimagine the guest experience.

By joining the Stayntouch Ambassador Program, participants will be able to:

* Earn an up-front cash bonus and a percentage of the subscription revenue for each qualified hotel referral that becomes a Stayntouch customer.

* Help hotel owners and operators explore and leverage Stayntouch’s flexible cloud PMS and cloud-based solutions while staying at the cutting edge of hospitality tech.

* Become an advocate for technological innovation within their professional networks.

Jason Jenkins, VP of Sales at Stayntouch said, “Modern cloud technology is reimagining the guest experience and dramatically changing the way hotels do business. Our hotel customers are benefiting from an incredible boost in profitability because of the nimble and intuitive nature of our software and that allows them to deliver better service to their guests. The Stayntouch Ambassador Program enables our hotel customers and partners to introduce our technology to their network of hotel professionals and give them the tools to dramatically increase their bottom line and enhance the guest experience.”

To join the program, participants must fill out an application through the Stayntouch Ambassador Program’s sign-up page. Once approved, ambassadors will be given the training and resources needed to begin educating and empowering their network, as well as refer hoteliers to Stayntouch and redeem cash incentives.
