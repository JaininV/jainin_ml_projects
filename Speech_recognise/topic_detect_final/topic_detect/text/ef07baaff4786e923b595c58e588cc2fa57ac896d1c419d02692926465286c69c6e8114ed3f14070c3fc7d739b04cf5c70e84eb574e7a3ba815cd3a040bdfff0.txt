I believe it is a 1956, flat latch, pre model 49 in factory nickel.

I picked up this and another one with a 'bug screw' in blue.

As Retired W4 said, there's no such thing as a pre-49.

S&W introduced its "concealed hammer revolver" as S&W President Carl Hellstrom called it at the 1955 International Association of Chiefs of Police conference and asked the chiefs to name it. "Bodyguard" one chief said, and it stuck.

When S&W assigned model numbers the Bodyguard became the Model 38.

That was an aluminum alloy frame. At the request of the Massachusetts State Police in 1959 S&W made the carbon steel Bodyguard and called it the Model 49.

The upper side plate screw (the fourth screw on a J-frame) is called the bug screw, according to Dr. Jinks. The tiny retainer screw holds the bug screw in place. Retainer screws were only used on Airweight models.

If you have a Bodyguard with a 4-screw frame and the retainer screw will you please share a photo of it with us. I've never seen one.
