Oliver Andrews, from Bournemouth, went to a nightclub with his friend on the last night of his holiday in Morocco.

While already spending five months behind bars, they have both been convicted for possessing and distributing counterfeit money on holiday.

Andrews' partner, Alanna Cornick, has promised to appeal the decision and has described it as the 'worst possible outcome'.

The duo - who were accused of creating an organised criminal group and making counterfeit money - were acquitted of those charges.

Prior to his sentencing, Ms Cornick said 'the condition that he's living in is just heartbreaking on a daily basis'.

"We just want the embassy to do their job and go and visit him, and make sure to check on his welfare," she said.

"I have had phone calls from him where he has been really really down and basically shared suicidal thoughts.

"It is the worst because there's nothing you can do."

Zoe, Mr Andrews' mother, said the family 'have given up trying to get anything done through the embassy'.

"As a family, we feel very let down and deserted by our own government," she added. "We, under no circumstances, want help with the legal case, just solely his welfare."

An FCDO spokesperson said at the time: "We are providing consular assistance to two British nationals arrested in Morocco and are in contact with the local authorities."

The pair are now waiting to be given a new court date when the case will be heard by a different judge.

Ainsworth's gang used a specialist printing machine to churn out fake £20 notes, but investigators were alerted to their presence after the Bank of England discovered £1.8 million in fake cash entering circulation in January 2019.

Investigators were able to uncover a London-based industrial unit owned by one of the gang members after tracking materials used in the process of printing the counterfeit notes.
