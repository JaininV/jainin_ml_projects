CORVALLIS, Ore. – Mikey Kane hit his fourth home run of the season and Travis Bazzana went 2-for-3 with three stolen bases to highlight Oregon State’s 6-3 win over USC Sunday at Goss Stadium at Coleman Field, giving the Beavers a three-game sweep.

With OSU up two, Kane hit the first pitch in the fourth over the fence in left to put OSU up 3-0. The Beavers added two more in the fifth to go up 5-1, and Mason Guerra drove in his second run of the game on a single in the seventh to give the Beavers (24-11 overall, 10-8 Pac-12 Conference) an insurance run.

Bazzana, meanwhile, singled to open OSU’s day offensively in the first, then reached on a bunt single in the fifth. He swiped his first bag of the day in the first, then took second and third on steals in the seventh after a walk, eventually scoring when Guerra singled past short.

Guerra’s two RBI led the Beavers, while Bazzana’s two hits led OSU’s offensive attack. The Beavers had eight hits as a team.

AJ Lattery picked up the win, improving to 4-0 on the year. The righty was the first of three relievers for the Beavers, and held USC (21-13-1, 9-6) to two hits and a run with two walks and three strikeouts in four innings.

Tyler Mejia then pitched the sixth before giving way to Ben Ferrer, who earned his first save of the season after three innings of work. He struck out four and scattered two hits and a run.

Eric Hammond took the loss, dropping to 2-3 on the year. USC’s starter, he allowed three hits and three runs in three innings of work.

Oregon State remains at home for a non-conference matchup with Seattle Tuesday night at Goss Stadium at Coleman Field. First pitch is slated for 5:05 p.m. PT.
