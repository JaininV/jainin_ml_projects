Need something to do this weekend? Weâ€™ve got a great idea: start with some light spring cleaning in your closet, then hit up shopDisney for some fun new looks! Nowâ€™s a PERFECT time, because A.) itâ€™s spring and B.) shopDisney has a sale happening right now!

While weâ€™re on the subject, weâ€™ve got good news and bad news. The good news is that the sale is still happening. The bad news is that today, April 16th, is the LAST DAY you can choose a free gift with your purchase on shopDisney! To save you a little time, weâ€™ve got a few suggestions!

If you find yourself on the shopDisney website this weekend, make sure to use code GIFT at checkout for free shipping AND a free gift if you spend $100+. When it comes to Disney merch, trust us, itâ€™s not hard to spend $100.

If youâ€™re looking for a little inspiration, weâ€™ve got you covered! Check out this new Mickey Mouse and Friends Disney100 Loungefly Backpack thatâ€™s filled with all our favorite Disney characters. What better way to celebrate the big anniversary than with a new bag?

If youâ€™ve visited Disney World in the past couple of years, you know that Loungefly backpacks are THE theme park accessory for Disney fans. You can grab this backpack right on the shopDisney website!

Speaking of accessories, we had to share these adorable Snow White Minnie Ears with ya. Look at the baby deer and the little chipmunk ðŸ¥º. Too. Cute.

These ears are part of the new Disney100 collection on shopDisney.

For your little ones, we found the most adorable LEGO DUPLO 3 In 1 Magical Castle set EVER. The set comes with Minnie, Mickey, Daisy, and Donald DUPLO characters â€” and even a little glass slipper!

You can find this set on shopDisney as part of the Disney100 merchandise collection!
