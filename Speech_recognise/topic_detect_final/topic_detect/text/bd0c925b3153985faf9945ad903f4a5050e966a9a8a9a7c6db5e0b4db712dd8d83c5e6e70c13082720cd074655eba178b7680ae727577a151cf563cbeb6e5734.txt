Derrick White had a big Game 2 against the Hawks as he scored 26 points, helping the Celtics take a 2-0 lead in the first round series.

The 28-year-old point guard even received ‘MVP’ chants from the crowd. But that wasn’t the focus of NBA legends Shaquille O’Neal and Charles Barkley as they discussed the game on TNT.

Both Shaq and Chuck could not stop laughing after seeing White’s postgame press conference. The cause of their laughter was the player’s hairline.

While Ernie Johnson and Kenny Smith attempted to talk about White’s game, O’Neal and Barkley kept laughing and making jokes.
