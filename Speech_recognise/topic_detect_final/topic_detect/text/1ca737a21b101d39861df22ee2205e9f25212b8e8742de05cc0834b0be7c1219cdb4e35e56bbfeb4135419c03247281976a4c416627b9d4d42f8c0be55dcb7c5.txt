The National Volunteer Fire Council (NVFC) is excited to share the National Firefighter Registry (NFR), the largest existing effort to understand and reduce cancer risk among firefighters. The NFR is open to all U. S. firefighters – paid or volunteer, active or retired, with or without cancer.

Studies have shown that firefighters’ exposure on the fireground may increase their risk of cancer. When you sign up for the NFR, researchers will match information you provide to cancer diagnosis information from state cancer registries. This will allow them to study the relationship between firefighting and cancer outcomes. The NVFC released a position statement in December strongly supporting the NFR and recommending that all members of the fire service enroll.

Answer the call. Join the NFR today at NFR.cdc.gov.
