Cricket is known to be a gentleman’s game and umpires and referees are tasked to ensure that the match is conducted within the laws, keeping the spirit of the game intact. However, there have been times when players have lost their cool on the cricket field and indulged in indecent behaviour.

The same has forced match officials to take cognizance and several players have also been penalised for the same when found guilty. Meanwhile, Indian Premier League (IPL), arguably the most popular franchise tournament in the world, has also witnessed instances where players have been involved in a heated exchange and have eventually been fined.

Mumbai Indians took the stage alongside Kolkata Knight Riders in the 22nd match of the 2023 season of the cash-rich league. Mumbai won the toss and opted to field first. In the first ball of the ninth over, Hrithik Shokeen dismissed KKR skipper Nitish Rana for five runs off 10 deliveries to provide a third wicket to his side.

During Rana’s walk to the pavilion, he and Shokeen were involved in a verbal spat. It got heated to an extent that Piyush Chawla and Suryakumar Yadav needed to intervene to calm things down. Nitish was fined 25 per cent of the match fee for breaching the IPL Code of Conduct while Hrithik was fined 10 per cent of his match fee.

Talking about the game, Kolkata posted 185 runs on the board, courtesy of a blistering century from Venkatesh Iyer (104 runs off 51 balls). However, Mumbai comfortably chased down the total in 17.4 overs. Ishan Kishan (58 runs off 25 balls) was the top scorer for the five-time IPL champions.
