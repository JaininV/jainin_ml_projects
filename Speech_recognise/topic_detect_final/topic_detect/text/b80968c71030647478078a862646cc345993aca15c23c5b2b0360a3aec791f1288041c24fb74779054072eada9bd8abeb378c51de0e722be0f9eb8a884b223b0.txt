Bath Rugby took the derby day spoils, scoring five tries behind enemy lines to win with a bonus point against Gloucester.

After going 17-0 behind, a penalty try and a Miles Reid converted score brought the Blue, Black and White to within three points at the break.

Gloucester pushed further ahead, however it was Bath who took away five points and the bragging rights.

First Joe Cokanasiga dived over from close range after smart play from Ben Spencer and Reid followed up with hisÂ second from close range.

On his return from injury, Sam Underhill wrapped up the contest muscling his way to the try and sending a large contingent of Bath fans home with a huge smile on their face!
