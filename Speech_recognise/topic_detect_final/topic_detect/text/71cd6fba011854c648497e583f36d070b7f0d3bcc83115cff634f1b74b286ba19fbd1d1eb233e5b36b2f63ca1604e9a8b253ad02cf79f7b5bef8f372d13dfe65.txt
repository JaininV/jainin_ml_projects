Octopath Traveler 2 is an exciting game that offers players the opportunity to explore a world filled with adventure and danger. One of the most challenging and rewarding quests in the game is the Ruffians’ Redoubt side quest. In this quest, players must navigate a hideout filled with powerful enemies and defeat them to claim their rewards. In this article, we will provide a comprehensive guide on how to complete the Ruffians Redoubt side story in Octopath Traveler 2.

To embark on this thrilling adventure, make your way to the Eastern Cape Cold Snow in Winterlands. Your first task is to find an NPC by the name of Peddler. Once you’ve located him, engage in conversation, and he will regale you with tales of bandits lurking upon this treacherous road. Our poor Peddler cannot even recall the number of times he has been assaulted while peddling his goods! It’s evident that these marauders have a hidden lair somewhere in the vicinity. If they persist with their plundering ways, they will undoubtedly damage his business irreparably.

To uncover the bandits’ secret hideout, journey eastward from the save point until you come across a Sentinel guarding their domain. Bravely dispatch him in combat and follow the path until it leads you to a serene lake. Here, board a small boat and voyage to the opposite shores further towards the east. Disembark the vessel and head left along the trail to eventually stumble upon the Ruffians’ Hideout.

Upon your discovery, they won’t take kindly to your intrusion, and thus a heated battle with these fierce ruffians will commence. Fear not, however, for they are relatively easy adversaries to defeat. Ruffian 1 is weak to swords, bows, Fire, and Light magic, Ruffian 2 is weak to daggers, bows, Fire, and Dark magic, and the Ruffian Leader is weak to polearms, axes, staves, and Lightning magic.

After defeating these foes, return to the Peddler and inform him of your success. A brief cutscene follows, signaling the conclusion of your valiant quest. To show his gratitude for your assistance, the Peddler gives you a reward of 6,000 Leaves and a Peddler’s Feathered Cap.
