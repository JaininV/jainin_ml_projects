If we constantly think about a thing that worries us or makes us fearful, internally what happens is every time we relive that worry (or fear or concern or  ) this thing becomes bigger and bigger in our head.

At some point we donâ€™t even realize this is happening to us, and becomes second nature to us.

Ergo, it takes the form of a mountain from what started as a molehill.

So the key is to not give this fear/worry/concern et al the power to grow and grow it shall. Do not feed it because when that happens, this mountain gains control over you. If and when we realize this is happening, slowly we start to wrest back control and the mountain diminishes in size.
