Have questions about funding opportunities, developing an application, or managing a grant award? Unsure who to contact for help? Don’t be scared to reach out to NIH staff – it’s literally our job!

You may be able to find answers to your questions through your institutional contacts or our online resources (Grants & Funding, Policy & Compliance, How to Apply, FAQs). If you’ve checked these sources and still need help, our Need Help page is a great place to start finding contacts for NIH grants administration questions. If you want a refresher on the ins and outs of what to do when seeking assistance from extramural staff, check out the NIH All About Grants podcast episode on How to Find Help. Sheri Cummins, with the NIH Office of Extramural Research’s communications group, explains where to find answers to many frequently asked questions and other information online, deciphering program, review, and grants administrative staff roles at NIH, when to reach out and when not to, and much more.
