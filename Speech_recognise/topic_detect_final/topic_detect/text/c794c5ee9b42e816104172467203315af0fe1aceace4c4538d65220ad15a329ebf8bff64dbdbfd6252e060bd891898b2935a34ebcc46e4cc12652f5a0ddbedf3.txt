The fans will see Sanju Samson and KL Rahul take on each other in the LSG vs RR IPL 2023 match at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur. Match number 26 between the Lucknow Super Giants and Rajasthan Royals will be a battle for the top spot as both the teams are currently no 1 and 2 in the present standings.

The KL Rahul-led Lucknow Super Giants are in red-hot form in the current Indian Premier League 2023 but are also coming off a two-wicket defeat against the Punjab Kings. Despite the loss in the last match the biggest positive LSG has received is Rahul's return to form. The team's captain scored 74 runs off 56 balls which included eight fours and one six.

Rajasthan Royals on the other hand under the leadership of Sanju Samson also seem to be having a good run till now in the Indian Premier League 2023 and defeated defending champions Gujarat Titans by three wickets. Jos Buttler and Yuzvendra Chahal have been the biggest performers of the RR team and the team would be hoping for the same performance against LSG.

Coming to the head-to-head record of the Rajasthan Royals and Lucknow Super Giants, both the teams have battled out each other twice and till now the men in purple are unbeaten against the KL Rahul-led franchise. IPL 2022, however, was the debut season of the Lucknow Super Giants and with the teams playing only two matches the much-awaited clash to take place in Jaipur can be a thriller.
