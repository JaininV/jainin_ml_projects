By John KeatsSon of the old Moon-mountains African!

Chief of the Pyramid and Crocodile!

We call thee fruitful, and that very while

A desert fills our seeing’s inward span:

Nurse of swart nations since the world began,

Art thou so fruitful? or dost thou beguile

Such men to honour thee, who, worn with toil,

Rest for a space ‘twixt Cairo and Decan?

O may dark fancies err! They surely do;

‘Tis ignorance that makes a barren waste

Of all beyond itself. Thou dost bedew

Green rushes like our rivers, and dost taste

The pleasant sunrise. Green isles hast thou too,

And to the sea as happily dost haste. Summary of To The NilePopularity of “To The Nile”: Written by the great Romantic English poet John Keats, this beautiful poem first appeared in 1918 but could not witness the light of the day until 1838, when he was long dead. When he composed it, he was just a young man aged 22. The beauty of the sonnet is not only in the information that Keats has displayed about world affairs and geography but also in the melody and ideas.“To The Nile” As a Representative of Nature and Beauty: The poet, who happens to be the speaker of the poem, presents the River Nile as the greatest manifestation of nature, being the son of the mountains and the main source of the world’s great monuments and creatures. Calling it the chief of the Pyramid and Crocodile, the poet goes on to call it fruitful, imagining that it waters the deserts, valleys, and “swart nations” that fall in its ambit. Due to the prolonged course of the river, the poem sees the river beguiling the people and winning honor through its zigzag course.

However, it is interesting to note that Keats is aware of Cairo and Decan but not aware of the distance between the two locations. It could be that Keats is aware of his own ignorance that he does not know much about the river. Therefore, he concludes the sonnet saying that it falls into the sea after making some green isles.Major Themes in “To The Nile”: The beauty of nature, the inscrutability of the river and poetic fancy are major thematic strands of the sonnet “To The Nile.” Although the poet has termed the Nile a mythical figure after he personifies it, he presents the beauty of nature by showing that it fills the desert and waters the nations. He is of the view that this river has been there since time immemorial. Yet, the poet questions the inscrutability of the river showing that it is uncertain how the men take rest when traveling and how it waters the nations. The thoughts of men could be based on ignorance though he seems sure that before falling into the river, it must have formed several green isles. Making this earth a good place, the river becomes happy when falling into the river. The poetic fancy sees the river making lands fertile and going into the sea to merge in the larger scheme of things.Analysis of Literary Devices Used in To The NileJohn Keats’s use of literary devices to enhance the intended impact of his poem is superb.
