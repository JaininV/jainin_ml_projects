Jurgen Klopp hailed his Liverpool players for “the best game we played this season” as they tore Leeds apart at Elland Road on Monday.

Diogo Jota and Mohamed Salah both scored twice, with further goals from Cody Gakpo and Darwin Nunez condemning Leeds to a 6-1 defeat.

After the game, Klopp said he was “really happy” with the performance, and was particularly impressed with the counter-pressing from his side.

“I think it is the best game we played this season from different aspects of the game,” he told Sky Sports.

“I think we forced a lot of errors, (scored) sensational goals, counter-pressing-wise it was the best for, I want to say, decades. Really happy about that game.”

A first win in six matches may have done nothing for Liverpool’s league position – they remain eighth – but they are now nine points adrift of fourth-placed Newcastle.

However, Klopp believes the confidence which started to return with a second-half comeback in their previous match against Arsenal gives them an outside chance of a run at Champions League qualification if they can put together a run like they did in the 2020-21 season.

“The second half against Arsenal was super-important for all of us,” he said. “There are still eight games to come and we have to do what we did tonight again and again.

“I hope these one-and-a-half games gives us a right sign for the end of the season.

“The difference between this season and that season is we are a bit further away (from the top four).

“We need to create something new, maybe, something slightly different.

“If the teams in front of us win all the games then we have no chance so we have to build on performances.

“I have no clue if we can get somewhere close but I don’t think it is too important.

“I would like to see us with the same desire and passion and understanding like we showed tonight and that’s the job to bring it on the pitch consistently.”
