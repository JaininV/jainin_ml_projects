A CURVY woman who claimed she liked a lot of attention a lot of the time, has been reassured by her fans.

In response to her post, one follower vowed to tell she was lovely a hundred times a day.

Jessica Peluso (@jessicapeluso6) describes herself on her TikTok as a “Broke curvy girl on a budget.”

A Nashville native, she plays up the Southern Belle image on her platform to perfection.

In her post, she looked demure in a polka-dot blouse and black trousers.

Her hair was tied back and she wore gold earrings.

“I’m not like other girls," she said, "not at all, not one bit."

This lady needed reassurance and was not afraid to ask for it.

“I’m constantly asking for more attention," she wrote.

“I need somebody to tell me how cute I am at least 13 times a day," she confessed.

If she didn't get it, she joked she would, "pass out and die.”

Affirmations came in fast and furious in her comment section.

“I would tell you a hundred times a day,” promised this smitten fan.

“I love everything about you," admitted another.

More confirmation should she need any came from this follower: “You are super adorable," he said.
