An Austraila based company will be able to relocate a manufacturing plant from China to Casper, thanks to a $600,000 grant.

The Casper/Natrona county economic development joint powers board made the request to the Wyoming business council, which presented funds to the state loan and investment board at its April 6th meeting.

With the move, Phoslock Envirnonmental technologies will be able to export Wyoming made products within the US and around the world.
