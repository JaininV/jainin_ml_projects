The Raleigh City Council is expected to approve funding for the project on Tuesday. The space would include one storefront and a shared kitchen for three vendors to share, according to the council's meeting agenda.

The food options at the hall would include coffee, sandwiches, crepes, pastries and other light items.

According to an existing lease agreement, the City would be completing the upfit of the space, while the vendors would be responsible for the special equipment and furnishings.

The total project is expected to cost about $490,000.

Raleigh has two larger food halls in the downtown area - Morgan Street and Transfer Co.
