“Alexandre Léger, creator of the famous Léger Wine Guide and emblematic figure in oenology, has just passed away, leaving behind a daughter, Camille, who hasn’t seen her father since her parents separated when she was nine years old. When Camille flies to Tokyo and Léger’s will is read, she discovers that her father has left her an extraordinary wine collection. But, to claim the inheritance, Camille must compete with a brilliant oenologist, Issei Tomine, who her father took under his wing and is referred to in Léger’s will as his “spiritual son.”

This eight-episode multilingual French-Japanese drama is adapted from the New York Times bestselling Japanese manga series of the same name created and written by award-winning Tadashi Agi, with artwork by Shu Okimoto and published by Kodansha. Drops of God stars Fleur Geffrier as Camille Léger and Tomohisa Yamashita as Issei Tomine.”

Based on The Drops of God manga series by Tadashi Agi and Shu Okimoto.
