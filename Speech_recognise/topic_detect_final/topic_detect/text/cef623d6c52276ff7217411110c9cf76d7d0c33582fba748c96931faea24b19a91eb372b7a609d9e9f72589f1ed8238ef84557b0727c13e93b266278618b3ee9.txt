KUALA LUMPUR, April 18 — Tan Sri Michelle Yeoh believes the Malaysian film industry has much potential to excel on the global stage.

The Academy Award-winning actress said today Malaysia has many stories to be told and be in the international entertainment scene.

“We have to be bold and courageous to know and believe in ourselves that we can.”

Yeoh advised Malaysian filmmakers not to limit themselves only to the local market but instead think globally.

“When you make a movie, it should be global.

“I know there are amazing filmmakers from this part of our world but we have to create opportunities and platforms for them to showcase their talent,” said Yeoh at a press conference at the Pavilion Kuala Lumpur Hotel.

She also advised aspiring actors and actresses to always show up and never give up in a bid to make their breakthroughs in the industry.

“For me, I kept looking and looking for the role and the team that believed we deserve the place, deserved to be seen and be heard in this way.”

Last month, Yeoh became the first Malaysian and Asian to win the Best Actress award at the 95th Academy Awards.

She was honoured with the Best Actress in a Leading Role award for Everything Everywhere All at Once at Hollywood’s most prestigious award ceremony at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles.
