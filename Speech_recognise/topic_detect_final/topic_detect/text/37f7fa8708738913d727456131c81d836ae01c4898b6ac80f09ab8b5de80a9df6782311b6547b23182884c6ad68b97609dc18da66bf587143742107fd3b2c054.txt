We've all considered how much better our home would be if we had an outdoor pool. There would be pool parties to throw, an activity for the kids, or a place to relax when the weather is warmer. When you decide to install an inground pool, it's best to think twice about your decision because sometimes you won't use it as much as you hoped. In most cases, you will continuously clean or maintain it so it doesn't get damaged. Some homeowners will keep their pool to increase the value of their home if there's a chance to sell it. However, other homeowners who plan to live in their homes for the rest of their lives might want to do something different with their backyard, so they decide to get rid of the pool.

There are various reasons why a homeowner might want to remove their pool. For example, they don't want to pay to maintain the pool, or their older pool needs multiple repairs, which could cost more than eliminating it. Regardless of the reason, removing an unused pool can cost between $2,700 and $19,000, but the national average is $6,000. Every pool situation will be different, depending on how large and deep the pool is, its constructed material, and the labor costs. Pool removal is a heavy and extensive project, so contracting professionals is highly recommended.
