Magic Kingdom has been going through some major changes lately.

Splash Mountain was closed to make way for Tiana’s Bayou Adventure, TRON Lightcycle / Run has officially opened, and Happily Ever After has returned! Because of the construction of Magic Kingdom’s newest coaster, Space Mountain even saw some modifications. This week, we noticed another big change hit this intergalactic coaster.

Before TRON Lightcycle / Run existed in Magic Kingdom, the Space Mountain exit was routed through Tomorrowland Light & Power Co., the ride’s gift shop.

During TRON construction, however, the shop was closed — and Space Mountain riders have been leaving through a modified exit that avoided the shop construction.

This shop has since been renamed Tomorrowland Launch Depot, and it is now home to TRON Merchandise, as well as the TRON Identity Program (where you can create your own custom TRON figure!) But up until now, even with the store reopened — Space Mountain riders were still exiting the modified way.

Recently, we noticed that Space Mountain guests were exiting through this shop again!

Tomorrowland Lauch Depot now serves as a space for both TRON Lightcycle / Run and Space Mountain. So far, we’ve mostly seen TRON merch in this store, but we’ll keep an eye out for any changes! In the meantime, you can also sometimes find Space Mountain merch in the Star Traders store on the other side of Tomorrowland.

We’ll keep an eye out for any more changes, so stay tuned to AllEars for more!
