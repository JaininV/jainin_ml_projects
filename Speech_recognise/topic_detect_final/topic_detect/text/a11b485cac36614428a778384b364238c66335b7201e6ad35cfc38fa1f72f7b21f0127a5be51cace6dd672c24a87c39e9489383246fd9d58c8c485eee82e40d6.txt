Cancer-fighting biotech Telix Pharmaceuticals hopes to follow in the footsteps of CSL to become a household name in healthcare, as the company builds on the success of its prostate cancer imaging tool and works on new products for kidney and brain cancer.

Telix boss Christian Behrenbruch said the company was just getting started after revealing on Tuesday it had hit $100.1 million in quarterly revenue. This was powered by sales of its first commercial product, Illuccix, which helps to pinpoint the recurrence of prostate cancer at an earlier stage than other products.

Telix shares rocketed by more than 10 per cent on Tuesday to an all-time high of $8.82 throughout the session after the business also recorded its second consecutive quarter of positive cash flow â€“ a rarity for a listed biotech company.

Behrenbruch said the numbers showed the Melbourne-based drug developer could successfully commercialise an in-demand product, and that he was excited to bring imaging and treatment tools for renal and brain cancer to market in the future.
