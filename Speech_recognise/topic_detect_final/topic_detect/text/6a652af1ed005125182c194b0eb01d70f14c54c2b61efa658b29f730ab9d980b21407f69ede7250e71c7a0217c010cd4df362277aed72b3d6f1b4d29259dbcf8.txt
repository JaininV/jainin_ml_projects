KSI labelled nemesis Jake Paul a "fraud" and claimed he is too SCARED to fight him.

Paul, 26, this month announced his latest fight against former UFC champion Nate Diaz.

The YouTuber-turned-boxer tasted defeat in the ring for the first time against Tommy Fury in their Saudi Arabia blockbuster in February.

And KSI claims Paul is fearful of losing once again, which is why he has decided to dodge a clash between the pair.

KSI, 29, said in a YouTube video: “That’s the problem with Jake Paul. He’s a fraud and people need to wake up to this fact. He can’t beat boxers.

“That’s why he’s staying clear from me, Salt Papi, Joe Fournier, etc.

“Ultimately, Jake Paul is scared of me. If we never manage to make this fight happen, I want you to know this Jake.

"You will forever be known as the man that claimed to want to avenge his brother’s loss, but ultimately was too scared to actually go through it.

“Enjoy your fight with another MMA fighter. When you’re actually ready to man up and end this feud with your boy KSI I’ll be here waiting.”

KSI previously called out Paul following his KO win over Faze Temperrr, and promised fans the bout would happen before the end of the year.

But the Brit has had to settle for fighting Joe Fournier next, with Paul dismissing the challenge of KSI as an "easy fight".

The American for Disney star, 26, said: "My last fight didn’t end the way I wanted, but the result was the best thing that could have happened to my professional boxing aspirations.

"Now, the world thinks I am vulnerable, when all I am is more focused than ever. My team wanted me to take an easy fight like KSI next, but that’s not how I am built."
