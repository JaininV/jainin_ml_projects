Our customer decided on a colour scheme of dark blues, greys and blush pink after doing their research for bedroom ideas on Pinterest, and looking at different colour combinations. Before starting the project they told us, “We always wanted a bedroom wardrobe with a sliding door design as they make the best use of space from floor to ceiling and we want to keep a minimal look.”

For this bedroom improvement project we used a range of made to measure wardrobe components so we were able to provide the exact storage requirements. We felt the wardrobe colours connected well with the colour combinations that the customer wanted and paint colours we decided to use in the room.

We have used Russ Deacon Home Improvements for our wardrobes and bathroom. Regarding the wardrobes, we are very happy with the finished product, they are very modern looking and have great storage. Each section of the wardrobe was designed separately so we ended up with exactly what we imagined, perfection! Thank you for helping us get closer to our dream home. We will definitely be back for the kitchen!
