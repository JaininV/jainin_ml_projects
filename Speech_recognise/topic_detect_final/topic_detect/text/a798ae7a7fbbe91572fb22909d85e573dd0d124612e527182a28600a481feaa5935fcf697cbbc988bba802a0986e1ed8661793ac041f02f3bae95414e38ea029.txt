I'm just a girl named Jessica from Pennsylvania. I have an amazing wife--my biggest supporter--and 5 crazy cats that make our days amusing. I'm headed NoBo on the AT with only a year of backpacking experience but hey, how else do we learn? I like long walks through the woods, drinking filtered creek water, and wondering if that noise was a bear who's about to eat all my food. Side note: I'd like to thank Doug for the inspiration to take this journey. If you're reading this, just know that the foundation and encouragement you gave me were monumental.
