J. T. Poston makes dreaded "hole-in-one" with second ball, is rightfully disgusted

It's every golfer's worse nightmare. Making a hole-in-one with a second golf ball. Of course, by definition, this is NOT a hole-in-one. Which is why it's such a nightmare.

Heck, it's why you should never hit a mulligan or even another practice shot after hitting your tee shot on a par 3. Because, if it goes in, welp.

But sometimes you have to re-tee. You know, like if you're a PGA Tour pro and you hit it in a hazard and there's no drop zone. Which, apparently, happened to J.T. Poston on Tuesday at Harbour Town. A video captured by his caddie, Aaron Flener, shows Poston's confirming his golf ball was in the cup on the par-3 17th hole after hitting a third shot (or a second tee shot). And him (rightly) looking pretty disgusted about the situation:

And here was Poston's reaction:

Yeah, that's tough. But even tougher? It all happened in a practice round. At least when Fred Couples famously dunked his second attempt on TPC Sawgrass' 17th hole it was with the cameras running during the Players Championship. This is just a total waste of a great perfect golf shot.

In any event, at least one of our expert pickers likes Poston's chances for a high finish at this week's RBC Heritage. And Poston knocking in shots like this will go a long way toward making that happenâ€”as long as they're on the first attempt.
