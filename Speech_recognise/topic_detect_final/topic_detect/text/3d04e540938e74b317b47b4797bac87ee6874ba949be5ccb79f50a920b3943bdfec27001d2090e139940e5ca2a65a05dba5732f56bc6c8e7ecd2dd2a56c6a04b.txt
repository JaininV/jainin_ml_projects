Tony Vitello returns to Fayetteville this weekend where he was an assistant coach for four seasons under Razorbacks head coach Dave Van Horn, as No. 16 Tennessee baseball continues SEC play with a trip to No. 5 Arkansas.

The Vols (23-10, 5-7 SEC) arrive in Fayetteville coming off a midweek win over Eastern Kentucky after losing their home series with No. 2 Florida last weekend. Vitello's group has lost back-to-back SEC series for the first time since the end of the 2019 season, his second as head coach on Rocky Top.

Arkansas (26-7, 8-4 SEC) hosts Tennessee after splitting a pair of midweek games with Little Rock. The Razorbacks won 21-5 on Tuesday before losing 11-4 on Wednesday. They've won two consecutive SEC series (Alabama and Ole Miss) entering the weekend.

***GAME ONE UPDATES: No. 16 Tennessee baseball at No. 5 Arkansas***

Tennessee's starting pitcher: Junior RHP Andrew Lindsey (0-1, 2.01 ERA, 0.909 WHIP) makes his first start of the season — 22.1 IP, 12 H, 8 R, 5 ER, 8 BB, 26 K, .158 opponent batting average

Arkansas' starting pitcher: Junior LHP Hunter Hollan (5-1, 3.00 ERA, 1.24 WHIP) makes his ninth start of the season — 42.0 IP, 38 H, 16 R, 14 ER, 14 BB, 39K, .247 opponent batting average

Vols utility man Jared Dickey led off the game and the weekend with a solo home run.

Tennessee would add a second run later in the inning when Arkansas starter Hunter Hollan balked with Vols second baseman Christian Moore standing on third base. Moore had singled with no outs following the Dickey home and advanced to third on a Griffin Merritt single.

Arkansas scored three in the third inning on a couple of Tennessee errors to take a 3-2 lead. After a leadoff single, Maui Ahuna was unable to snag a Christian Moore toss that should have resulted in a 4-6-3 double play. The ball trickled into centerfield allowing both runners to reach and put runners on the corers with no outs.

The Hogs tried to steal second and when Cal Stark's throw sailed into centerfield, the runner from third scored. The next hitter — Tavian Josenberger — then hit a two-run home run to give Arkansas a 3-2 lead.

Arkansas tacked on a run in the fourth inning after loading the bases loaded with no outs. The Hogs traded a double play for a run to extend the lead to 4-2. It would be the only run they scored as Kirby Connell and Seth Halvorsen came in and got the Vols out of the jam.

Arkansas left fielder Jace Bohrofen hit a solo home run in the fifth inning to extend the lead to 5-2.
