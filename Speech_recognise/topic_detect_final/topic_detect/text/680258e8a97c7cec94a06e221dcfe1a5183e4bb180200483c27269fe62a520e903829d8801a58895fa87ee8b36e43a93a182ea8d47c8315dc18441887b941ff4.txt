Now, Salman Khan's leading lady in KKBKKJ, Pooja Hedge reacted to Palak Tiwari's comment during an interview with Zoom. Pooja said, "He is been great that way with me. I think, even I, as a person, am very protective about my own people, my family and all of that. And I am one of those 'apna' people. So, it's been great that way. He is who he is and says what's on his mind; that's very refreshing for me. It's been great."

She added, "It's also cause he speaks his mind. A lot of people think it but they don't say it whereas he says what's on his mind. It is very clear and that can sometimes make people be like 'Oh my God!' It takes you aback because you are not used to people speaking their minds."

Previously in an interview with, Siddharth Kannan, Tiwari said, "When I was AD-ing with Salman sir on Antim, Salman sir had a rule: 'Every girl on my set, the neckline should be here, all the girls should be covered, like good proper girls.'"
