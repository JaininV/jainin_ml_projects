THE Zimbabwe Special Olympics Games team got a morale booster ahead of their trip to Berlin in Germany for the winter games in June.

The team that has been in camp last month received a donation of US$15 000, which will be channelled to the refurbishment of tennis courts that they will use during their preparations.

Luke Watsonâ€™s Lion Heart Foundation came on board to assist Team Zimbabwe, who in the past have won several medals in athletics, golf and borsch.

Lion Heart Foundation is chaired by 18-year-old Luke Watson, who is a student at a United Kingdom University.

The foundation will refurbish three tennis courts to the tune of US$15 000 for use by the Zimbabwe Special Olympics team preparing for the World Games in Germany this coming June.

They have also donated a kit that includes 200 tennis rackets, 200 tennis balls, 200 t-shirts, 50 tracksuits and 100 medals. They have also spruced up the Prince Edward tennis pavilion for use by special Olympics Zimbabwe athletes.
