Police: 3 injured after shooting in downtown Cincinnati. Here's what we know

RACHEL, WHAT CAN YOU TELL US? WELL, CURTIS AND LINDSAY, THIS WAS DEFINITELY A VERY SCARY SITUATION FOR EVERYONE. POLICE TELL US THREE PEOPLE WERE SHOT IN BROAD DAYLIGHT AND WITNESSES WE SPOKE WITH SAY THEY WERE EATING ICE CREAM JUST FEET AWAY WHEN THE GUNFIRE ERUPTED AND THAT’S WHEN THEY TOOK COVER. GUNFIRE ERUPTING IN THE CENTRAL BUSINESS SECTION OF DOWNTOWN. WE SAW MANY PEOPLE, 20 OR 30 PEOPLE RUNNING FROM THAT DIRECTION AND THEN RUNNING UP AND DOWN RACE FOR COVER. AND THEN WE MAY HAVE SEEN THE MAN AS WELL WHO SHOT ONE CABRERA AND BRIMAH WERE EATING ICE CREAM JUST FEET AWAY FROM THE SCENE WHEN THEY HEARD MULTIPLE GUNSHOTS. IT WAS DIFFICULT BECAUSE I NEVER HEARD GUNSHOT THAT CLOSE BEFORE. AND SO I WAS UP AND DOWN TRYING TO, LIKE, GET A SENSE OF THE SITUATION. AND AFTER LIKE THE THIRD ROUND OF LIKE FIVE SHOTS WAS WHEN WE STARTED TO APPROACH THE SCENE TO SEE IF LIKE EVERYONE WAS OKAY OR IF THERE WAS ANYTHING WE COULD DO. CINCINNATI POLICE TELL US THREE PEOPLE WERE SHOT NEAR GARFIELD PLACE AND VINE STREET, ALL OF THEM WERE RUSHED TO THE HOSPITAL WITH NON-LIFE-THREATENING INJURIES, INCLUDING A 29 YEAR OLD MAN AND TWO WOMEN. IT APPEARS THAT THERE WAS A GROUP OF PEOPLE CONGREGATING IN A PARK ENJOYING NICE WEATHER TODAY. AND UNFORTUNATELY FOR SOMEONE IN THE CROWD, IT APPEARS STARTED THE FIRE. SOME SHOTS THAT OCCURRED WHICH RESULTED IN THE SHOOTING VICTIMS THAT WE LOCATED. OFFICERS IN THE AREA ADMINISTERED AID WITHIN MINUTES. AND NOW THE INVESTIGATION BEGINS AS TO WHY THIS HAPPENED. WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THERE’S ANY GREATER RISK TO THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE. IT APPEARS THAT THIS WAS A TARGETED EVENT THAT WAS NOT RANDOM IN ANY SOURCE. WITNESSES TELL US IT ALL UNFOLDED SO FAST, BUT THEY’RE GRATEFUL EVERYONE IS GOING TO BE OKAY. 30 SECONDS. I MEAN, NOT LIKE FROM THE TIME WE HEARD THE YELLING TO THE TIME WE MAY HAVE SEEN THE MAN RUN AWAY. WAS IT MORE THAN 30 SECONDS? INVESTIGATORS ARE STILL SEARCHING FOR A SUSPECT. IF YOU HAVE ANY INFORMATION ON THIS TRIPLE SHOOTING. YOU’RE ASKED TO CONTACT CINCINNATI POLICE. WE’RE LIVE TONIGHT FROM DISTRICT ONE HEADQUARTERS, RACHEL HORKHEIMER
