The 22 new vibrant designs offer the freedom to mix and match materials to bring your client’s dream spaces to life. With more design and application options backed by a lifetime warranty, you can offer your customers more creativity and flexibility and with peace of mind you can trust from Caesarstone.

Caesarstone Porcelain marks a leap in technology, functionality, and design by introducing three innovative properties that deliver a high degree of durability, strength and style.

The Fortified Frame provides an extremely hard surface, incredibly resistant to scratches, pressure, and rupture, enabling it to stand up to the most demanding high-volume use.

The High-Heat Structure forms a resilient surface that is extremely resistant to high temperatures, enabling direct contact with heated objects. The blend of natural ingredients secures UV resistance for outdoor use.
