Kudos to the artists participating in OakArt 2023: Oakton Annual Art Students Exhibitions. The students have produced wonderful works in a wide range of media. Some are serious, others whimsical. All are well done and very creative. It's good to know there are such talented artists in the community. I recommend viewing the free show in the Koehnline Museum of Art at Oakton College. The exhibit ends April 28, so hurry.
