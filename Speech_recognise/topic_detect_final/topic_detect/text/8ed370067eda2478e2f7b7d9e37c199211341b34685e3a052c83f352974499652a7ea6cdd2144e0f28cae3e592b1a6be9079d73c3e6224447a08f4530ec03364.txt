Robert Horry: “I’m not just saying this because I was on those Rockets team, but yeah, we would’ve beaten those Michael Jordan Bulls teams. I don’t think people understand how good Hakim Olajuwon. I want you to go through and think of every team that’s won an NBA championship. Every one of those teams had at least two or three All-Stars on their rosters. We had one, and that was Olajuwon, and we were able to win that Championship coming back down from 2-0. I know MJ is the greatest of all-time, but sometimes the greatest of all-time falls, and Orlando proved that when they beat him in 1995... I have so much love for MJ, but don’t disrespect Hakim Olajuwon, because he would’ve been a tough matchup for them.”
