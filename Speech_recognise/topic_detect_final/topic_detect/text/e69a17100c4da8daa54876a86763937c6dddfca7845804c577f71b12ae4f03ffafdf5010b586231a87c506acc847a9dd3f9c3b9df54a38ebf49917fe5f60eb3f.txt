New customers who take one of Shell Energy’s full fibre (FTTP) broadband plans, which are based off Openreach’s UK network, may like to know that the ISP has just cut another £5 off the monthly price for their first 18 month minimum contract term. The new promotion is expected to be available to order until 2nd May 2023.

The reduction, for example, brings the cost of their Full Fibre 100Mbps package down to just £26.99 per month for the full 18-month term (£42.74 thereafter) and Full Fibre 900Mbps falls to just £40.99 (£65.24 thereafter). On top of that, the packages also still appear to include an online shopping voucher worth between £100 and £175.

However, post & packaging costs will increase to £9.95 (one-off) from the current £5.57. But it’s worth noting that Shell Energy is currently the subject of significant market speculation, with some sources predicting that it may be acquired by utility provider Ovo Energy (here), which could later look to sell off the broadband base like they did with SSE before.
