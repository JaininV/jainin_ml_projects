THE Johor Baru Sessions court today ordered a teenager to be given seven light strokes of the cane for causing undue pain to a dog last month.

Judge Che Wan Zaidi Che Wan Ibrahim meted out the sentence on Braden Yap Hong Sheng, 19.

The court also ordered Yap to be placed on a good-behaviour bond for one year with a surety of RM10,000.

Last April 12, Yap pleaded guilty to a charge of causing undue pain to a brown female dog in front of a premises at Jalan Impian Emas 22, Taman Impian Emas, Skudai, at 1.49am, on March 27.

The charge was framed under section 29(1)(e) of the Animal Welfare Act 2015, which provides for a fine of up to RM100,000 or a maximum imprisonment of three years or both, if found guilty.

The court set May 21 for the execution of the light whipping sentence, to be carried out publicly at the Criminal Sessions Court 4 at 9am.

The prosecution was conducted by Johor Veterinary Services Department prosecuting officer Mohd Zamri Shak @ Ishak, while lawyer G. K. Sritharan represented Yap. – Bernama, April 18, 2023.
