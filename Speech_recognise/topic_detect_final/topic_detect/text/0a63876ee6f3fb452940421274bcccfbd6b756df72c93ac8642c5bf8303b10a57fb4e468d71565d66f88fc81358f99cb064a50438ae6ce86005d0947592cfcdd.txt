In January 2020, 40 years later that is, a few of the band's fans took matters into their own hands. They met with the mayor of Namur, Maxime Pr√©vot, and told him about the concert, which is mentioned in AC/DC biographies. They felt something should be done. Naming a street after Johnson or the band, for example.

The corona crisis threw a spanner in the works, but on 29 June 2021 - exactly 41 years after the concert - the Namur city council finally unanimously votedto name the square in front of the Expo venue after the group: Esplanade AC/DC was born. And today, on that same square, a statue of lead singer Brian Johnson has been unveiled, surrounded by happy fans.
