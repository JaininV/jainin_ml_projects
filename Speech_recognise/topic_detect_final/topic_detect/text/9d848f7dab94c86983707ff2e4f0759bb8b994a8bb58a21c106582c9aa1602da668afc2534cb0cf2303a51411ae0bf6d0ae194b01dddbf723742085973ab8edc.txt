Assessment: At Yad Vashem, president urges Israelis to set aside overhaul tensions for national days of unity, pans Nazi comparisons; Netanyahu says past victories don’t ensure future wins …

Israelis on Monday evening marked the annual Holocaust Memorial Day, coming together to commemorate the six million Jews murdered by the Nazis, despite deep societal divisions over the government’s plan to overhaul the judiciary.

At the main ceremony held at Jerusalem’s Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial, President Isaac Herzog noted the internal tensions, urging Israelis to set them aside for the commemorations and other upcoming national holidays.

“This year is no ordinary year. And this memorial day is like no other. This year, feelings are rough and shoulders are hunched, as if to attest to the weight of the discord bearing down on us,” he said. “Let us leave these sacred days, which begin tonight and end on Independence Day, above all dispute; let us all come together, as always, in partnership, in grief, in remembrance.”

“Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.’ Psalm 23:4

Herzog focused his remarks on a little-known, yet chilling, aspect of the Nazi project to exterminate the Jewish people, recalling the stories of two of the 86 Jews killed at the Natzweiler-Struthof camp, on French soil. Their bodies were later sent to be exhibited in a planned “museum of skulls and skeletons of an extinct race,” which Herzog described as a “museum of horrors that the Nazi beast planned.”

“A collection of limbs belonging to our brothers and sisters, whose bodies were cut open, chopped up, and shoved into test tubes and glass bottles to be displayed and catalogued in an orderly fashion,” Herzog said.
