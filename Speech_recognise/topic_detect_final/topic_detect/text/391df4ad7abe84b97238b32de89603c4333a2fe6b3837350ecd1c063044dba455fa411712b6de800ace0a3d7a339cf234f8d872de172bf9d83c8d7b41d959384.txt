To overcome the false alarm problem that arises for mine wind-velocity sensors due to air-door and mine-car operation, a wind-velocity disturbance identification method based on the wavelet packet transform and gradient lifting decision tree is proposed. In this method, a multi-scale sliding window discretizes continuous wind-velocity monitoring data, the wavelet packet transform extracts the hidden features of discrete data, and a gradient lifting decision tree multi-disturbance classification model is established. Based on the overlap degree rule, the disturbance identification results are merged, modified, combined, and optimized. In accordance with a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression, the air-door operation information is further extracted. A similarity experiment is performed to verify the method performance. For the disturbance identification task, the recognition accuracy, accuracy, and recall of the proposed method are 94.58%, 95.70% and 92.99%, respectively, and for the task involving further extraction of disturbance information related to air-door operation, those values are 72.36%, 73.08%, and 71.02%, respectively. This algorithm gives a new recognition method for abnormal time series data.

During the normal production period of a mine, air-door and mine-car operations are necessary to satisfy the production demand; however, these operations cause abnormal fluctuations in the wind-velocity sensor data. The air door is an important structure in the mine, and its main function is to isolate the wind flow in the tunnel and to guide the wind-flow direction [1, 2]. Mine cars constitute important mine transportation equipment and are characterized by flexibility and a wide application range. They are responsible for transportation of ore, waste rock, equipment, and people within the mine [3, 4]. However, the wind-flow structure changes caused by air-door operation, as well as the weak piston effect caused by mine-car operation, generate abnormal fluctuations with time delays and chaotic fluctuation ranges in the wind-velocity monitoring data for the relevant tunnel or for associated tunnels affected by the turbulent pulsation of the wind flow itself [5, 6]. Because these abnormal fluctuations are similar to power quality signal disturbances, the air-door and mine-car production activities are collectively referred to as “wind-velocity disturbances.”

When a disturbance generates abnormal fluctuations in wind-velocity data, the monitoring system output can easily be misinterpreted as indicating incidents such as tunnel collapses and air-door damage; thus, false alarms can arise, causing resource wastage or property loss. Therefore, disturbance identification and further information extraction for abnormal wind-velocity data fluctuations caused by various disturbances can improve production efficiency and reduce loss. A wind-velocity sensor generates time-series data, and disturbance-induced wind-velocity data fluctuations constitute abnormal time-series data; thus, any technique for identifying a disturbance from the associated wind-velocity sensor monitoring data essentially corresponds to an abnormal time-series detection method.

Existing time-series anomaly monitoring methods mainly utilize data preprocessing, feature extraction, and recognition methods. In terms of data preprocessing, data standardization and discretization are two common techniques, and the common data standardization methods include deviation standardization [7], standard deviation standardization [8], entropy difference standardization [9], and range standardization proportion [10]. Among these methods, deviation standardization is most suitable for wind-velocity monitoring data that is mostly stationary, with only a small range of abnormal fluctuations. Common data discretization methods include equidistance discretization [11], equifrequency discretization [12], sliding window discretization [13], and k-means clustering algorithm discretization [14]. Sliding window discretization is often used in object recognition tasks and has yielded better recognition results than other methods. Some improved methods based on continuous application of sliding window discretization have been proposed; these methods use adaptive sliding windows [15], multi-scale sliding windows (MSSWs) [16], and semi-fixed length sliding windows [17], for example. Among these techniques, the data discretized by the MSSW have a large redundancy; thus, this technique is only suitable for time-series datasets containing small volumes of data.

Commonly used feature extraction methods are often based on the Fourier transform [18], wavelet transform (WT) [19], sparse representation [20], empirical mode decomposition [21], or other signal processing technologies. The WT is suitable for analyzing the transient characteristics of a sudden signal and has been widely used for power quality transient-disturbance identification and detection, power quality disturbance data compression, and signal reconstruction [18, 19]. On the basis of the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and other WTs, wavelet packet (WPT) technology has been developed to overcome the poor high-frequency signal resolution yielded by WTs [22].

As regards recognition methods, artificial intelligence (AI) is being incorporated in an increasing number of studies aiming to improve anomaly recognition algorithm performance. Commonly used AI and machine learning models include the naive Bayes algorithm [23], support vector machine (SVM) [24], gradient lifting decision tree (GBDT) [25], and back propagation neural network (BP) [26]. In particular, the GBDT model is a decision tree algorithm based on a gradient lifting framework, which inherits the advantages of the statistical model and AI method. Compared with other machine learning models, the GBDT model has the advantages of high prediction accuracy and good processing of low-dimensional data.

In this study, the advantages of the deviation standardization, MSSW, WPT, and GBDT techniques are combined with the basic disturbance-induced wind-velocity variation law to construct a multi-disturbance identification method referred to as “MSSW-based WPT-GBDT.”

First, the wind-velocity time-series data collected by a single sensor are preprocessed using deviation standardization and an MSSW and then transformed into sub-time-series data within a unified variation range, which is convenient for subsequent feature extraction. Then, a statistical method is employed to extract some features, and WPT is used to extract the multilayer high- and low-frequency coefficients of each sub-time-series data. By calculating the entropy of the high- and low-frequency coefficients of each layer, more of the features are obtained. Then, GBDT is used to learn and identify the wind-velocity monitoring data characteristics under different disturbance types and conditions. Finally, the recognition results are combined and selected based on the intersect over union (IoU) (i.e., the overlap degree) and confidence degree, and are used to achieve high average recognition accuracy and generalization performance. In addition, this algorithm gives a new recognition method for abnormal time series data.

A similarity experiment and change rule for air-door operation were introduced and discussed in detail in the Lijun Deng’s previous studies [1, 2]. Therefore, in the present study, only the mine-car operation similarity experiment, the MSSW-based WPT-GBDT mine multi-disturbance recognition algorithm, and the verification tests are presented. The verification tests confirm the efficacy of the proposed multi-disturbance recognition algorithm when applied to mine wind-velocity data.
