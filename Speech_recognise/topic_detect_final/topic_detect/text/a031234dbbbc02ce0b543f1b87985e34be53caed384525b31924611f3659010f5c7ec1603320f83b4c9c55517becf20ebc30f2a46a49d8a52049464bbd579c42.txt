Fan-favorite Brazilian striker Edson Barboza, owner of some of the best highlights in UFC history, faced off with Billy Quarantillo in the co-main event of UFC Kansas City.

Barboza moved down to featherweight a few years back, and despite back-to-back losses was still ranked fourteenth in the division to start the night. His age of 37 appeared to be becoming an issue, as his last fight against Bryce Mitchell was a particularly rough one, with the grappling specialist dropping Barboza. Meanwhile “Billy Q” is known for a high paced fight style and a multi-faceted attack of wrestling and striking, which he would try to use to break into the rankings at 145-lbs.

Quarantillo came straight out and swung an overhand into a single leg takedown to start Saturday’s co-main event. He grabbed it and pushed Edson back to the fence but was forced off of the single leg into the clinch. Edson then got back to range and tried to use his explosive striking, particularly leg kicks.

Billy looked to press forward constantly to not let Barboza do so. Edson landed some good shots but Quarantillo just kept walking him down, trying to melt Barboza. Billy shot for a single leg from far out and failed but again got into the clinch. Suddenly, as Billy Quarantillo ran forward to attack again, Edson Barboza threw up a high knee which Quarantillo ran right onto. Billy Q fell onto the floor in a slump, out cold, and the fight was stopped.

It was a great return to the highlight reels for Edson Barboza and fans all over were surely happy to see him back in the win column. The win isn’t Barboza’s first high-light reel knee, either, as it was a knee that he put away Beneil Dariush with in 2017, though that one was of the flying variety.
