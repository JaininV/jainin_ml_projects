Volunteers are vital to ERIC - we couldnâ€™t do what we do without you.

Our volunteers come from all walks of life and some have personal experience of the issues we are trying to address.

You can bring a wealth of expertise and experience to our charity and, most important of all, your enthusiasm and motivation to help families affected by childhood bowel and bladder conditions.
