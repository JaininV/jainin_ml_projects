Popular Nigerian actor, Kunle Remi is trending online for struggling to hold back his tears while reacting to the recent snub by AMVCA.

In a video he shared, Kunle Remi thanked everyone who reached out to him after the AMVCA nominations were announced, and he didn’t get any nomination.

This is coming despite two of the movies in which he was the lead got nominations in different categories. Anikulapo got 16 different nominations while Ijakumo got 3 and yet, the movie star wasn’t nominated but his co-star in Anikulapo, Bimbo Ademoye was nominated for the best actress in West Africa.

However, in the clip, Kunle Remi while pretending to hold back his tears called on people to stop pitying him and send him money instead. He reiterated that he has to focus on content creation since AMVCA has decided to ignore him. see video below:
