Acting Tottenham head coach Cristian Stellini vowed to support Davinson Sanchez in his “tough moment” after the centre-back was booed off the pitch during Saturday’s 3-2 home loss to Bournemouth.

Sanchez came on for injured Clement Lenglet after 35 minutes but felt the frustration of home supporters at the start of the second period when he inadvertently set up Dominic Solanke to make it 2-1 to the visitors.

The defender’s first touch after the goal was booed and Stellini withdrew the Colombian in the 58th minute.

Stellini, who watched his side lose in stoppage time to Dango Ouattara’s curled effort, said: “It’s a tough moment for everyone and we have to analyse this moment. Everyone needs to analyse how important it is to support the player.

“I take the responsibility for the decision we made. I thought it was early in the game to use a striker more because it was the first half and we were one up, so I didn’t think it was the moment to change with a striker.

“After, when we were 2-1 down I thought it was the moment. Davinson has to know it was only a tactical decision but we need to support him because it’s a tough moment for him and also for all the team.

“We have to create unity in our dressing room and in between us and we will do.��

Asked if he would have any issue playing Sanchez in Spurs’ next home game against Manchester United on April 27, Stellini insisted: “If we need, yes. He’s a professional player.

“We need to go strong for the team. But I repeat, if the team pushed more when we scored the first goal, we are here to speak about a different situation. It’s the mindset that needs to change, not only Davinson; it’s the whole team that can help, every player that came onto the pitch.”

Tottenham captain Hugo Lloris was critical of the decision to boo Sanchez during an interview with beIN Sport.

Lloris added: “I’ve never seen this in my career. I feel really bad for Davinson.

“He’s a team-mate, he’s a friend and he’s been fighting for the club for many many years now, and it’s just sad.

“The story is sad for the club, for the fans, for the player. It’s something you don’t want to see in football.”
