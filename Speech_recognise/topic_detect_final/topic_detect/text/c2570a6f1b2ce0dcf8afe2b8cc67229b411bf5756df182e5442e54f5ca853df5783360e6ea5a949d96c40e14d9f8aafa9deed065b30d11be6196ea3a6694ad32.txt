Avocado is known to be one of the most popular superfoods. This ingredient is widely associated with fitness goals and healthy eating. Avocados can be consumed in a variety of ways - they can be used to make spreads, salads, soups and much more. However, a recent video shared on Twitter shows an avocado dish that you may not have seen before. It is not unusual to combine avocados and eggs in a meal, but this method is certainly unique. The person who posted the video captioned it, "Cadbury Avocado Nightmare" - mostly because, in a way, it reminded them of Cadbury eggs (an egg-shaped chocolate treat with a fondant filling).

Twitter user @ericriveracooks shared a screen recording of a video originally posted by @easycookingbaking071. In it, we see a woman holding up two halves of an avocado. The seed has been removed and she goes on to place a boiled egg in the hollow space. She then puts the two halves together and rolls the stuffed avocado in flour. She covers it with an egg wash, followed by a breadcrumb coating. She then deep-fries the avocado until it turns golden brown on the outside. After garnishing it with parsley and paprika, she cuts it open to reveal a runny yolk. She finally seasons the dish with some salt and pepper. Wondering whether she liked it?

Instead of preparing these exact ingredients in a simpler and healtier way, I'm going to heat up an entire pot of oil and dirty a bunch of dishes to deep fry ONE breaded avocado egg.
