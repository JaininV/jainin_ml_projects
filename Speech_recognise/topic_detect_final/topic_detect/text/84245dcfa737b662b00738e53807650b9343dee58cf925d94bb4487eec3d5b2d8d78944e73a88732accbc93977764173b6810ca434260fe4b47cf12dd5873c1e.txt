The incident reportedly occurred at a local pub in the early morning hours. Police responded to a call from a minor who complained of a sexual assault. The Israeli shot-stopper, who was reportedly there with a teammate and confronted the minorâ€™s friends beforehand, was found in possession of drugs and was arrested.
