,  /PRNewswire/ -- Today, Ginkgo Bioworks (NYSE: DNA), which is building the leading platform for cell programming and biosecurity, is hosting its annual conference, Ferment. The conference brings together stakeholders from across the synthetic biology community, including customers, suppliers, academics, journalists, and many more. Because the event has reached its in-person capacity limits, a livestream will be available on Ginkgo's YouTube page and Ginkgo's Investor Relations page.

Ferment will begin with a keynote address from Ginkgo co-founder and CEO Jason Kelly, who will discuss the value that outsourcing R&D to a horizontal platform creates for customers across markets, including pharmaceuticals, agriculture, and industrial biotechnology. His presentation will also introduce new services offerings. These services offerings - like Ginkgo Enzyme Services, which was launched in December 2022 - make Ginkgo's capabilities and biological data assets more accessible to its customers.

Ginkgo Enzyme Services: Discover, engineer, optimize, and scale up your enzyme. Whether you're looking for a biocatalyst to replace a chemical synthesis step, looking to improve your enzyme's function, or aiming to lower your manufacturing costs, Ginkgo's end-to-end capabilities empower your enzyme R&D.

Watch the virtual event here and visit Ginkgo's Enzyme Services page to learn more.

Ginkgo Microbe Services: Leverage synthetic biology at scale. Whether you're looking into biological solutions for challenges in agriculture, natural product discovery, microbiome therapeutics, or any other area in which strain optimization can present a bottleneck, Ginkgo can help.

Learn more about Ginkgo's strain improvement work at its virtual event here, and about Ginkgo's offerings in agriculture and its Strain Optimization Services on Ginkgo's website.

Ginkgo AAV Services: An integrated suite of solutions.
