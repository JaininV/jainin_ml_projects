The incident occurred shortly before 2pm on Sunday at the Carowinds park in Charlotte.

The boy climbed inside the Cosmic XL Bonus Game with the intention of stealing a prize.

Photos of the bizarre site were shared on Facebook by the Carowinds Fans Only fan page in which the boy can be clearly seen sitting inside the machine while surrounded by staff members, a sheriff's deputy, and curious onlookers.

Park officials sprang into action to resolve the situation and summoned a medical team to resolve the issue who were able to rescue the boy a short time later.

The boy was given first aid before being handed over to his guardian.

'The safety and security of our guests and associates is Carowinds' top priority,' park officials went on to say.

The Cosmic XL Bonus Game is about 6.5 feet tall, nearly 5 feet wide and 5 feet deep, making it much bigger than the average claw game.

No charges were filed against the boy for his actions but he has been banned from visiting the park for a year as punishment.

A similar incident happened in February 2018 when young boy who wanted to  snatch a stuffed toy from inside a claw machine at a restaurant in Florida ended up getting stuck inside.

On that occasion, firefighters helped free him from the claw game.
