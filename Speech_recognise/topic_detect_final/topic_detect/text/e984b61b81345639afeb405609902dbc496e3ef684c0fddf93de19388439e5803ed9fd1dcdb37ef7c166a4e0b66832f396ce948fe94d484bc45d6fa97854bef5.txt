Ravi announces exit from K-pop band VIXX; admits he made 'foolish decision' as he was "desperate to delay my military service"

Ravi announces exit from K-pop band VIXX; admits he made 'foolish decision' as he was "desperate to delay my military service"South Korean rapper Ravi has announced his exit from the K-pop band VIXX.

The news of his departure from the band comes after he was surrounded by allegations of trying to avoid his mandatory military service by providing false medical documents that suggested he suffered from epilepsy.

The rapper had been booked for evading military service, with prosecutors demanding a two-year prison sentence.

After news broke of the same, the K-pop star took to his handle to issue a statement that read, "Hello, this is Ravi. First of all, I would like to say sorry to all those who have been damaged and hurt because of my mistake."

While stating that he suffered from epilepsy in the past, he admitted, "I was postponing my service."

The 30-year-old went on to add, "I was desperate to delay my military service. With desperation, I made a foolish decision, and when my worries about the company and the contract issues were resolved, I voluntarily registered for public service and was carrying out my service since October of last year."

He continued, "I would like to sincerely apologize to the epilepsy patients and their families who must have been hurt by this self-justified wrong decision I made in this process along with everyone required to serve who is diligently carrying out their duty even at this moment. Furthermore, I sincerely apologize to all the people who were hurt by me and to the fans who passionately supported my life beyond my existence as an artist for making you all experience the feeling that the time we spent together is being denied and falling apart. I wanted to be someone you could be proud of, but I have no excuse for showing such a shameful side of myself. Compared to everyone’s valuable feelings which were developed sincerely over a long period of time, I think I was very lacking."

"Lastly, I decided to leave VIXX so that no further damage would be given to the team members who were harmed by my fault. I am sincerely grateful to all the members who have been with me for the long period of 11 years, and I feel apologetic beyond words. I sincerely hope that there will be no more harm caused to the members’ valuable efforts because of me. I think I am a person who is lacking a lot and still has much to learn. I think it is my responsibility to take all the criticism over this incident. The more you scold me, the more I will repent and learn from it. I know very well that my simple words of apology do not make my faults go away. I will continue to learn and work hard so that I can live as a better person by reflecting on this moment without forgetting it. I sincerely apologize," he concluded.

The band's agency, Jellyfish said in the statement reported by Soompi, "After careful discussion between Ravi and the agency, it was decided that he will leave the team as of today."

"We deeply apologize for causing trouble to the fans who support VIXX," it added.

According to reports, a verdict on Ravi's prison sentence will be coming out soon. Jellyfish Entertainment, on the other hand, has confirmed that Ravi will not be a part of VIXX anymore.
