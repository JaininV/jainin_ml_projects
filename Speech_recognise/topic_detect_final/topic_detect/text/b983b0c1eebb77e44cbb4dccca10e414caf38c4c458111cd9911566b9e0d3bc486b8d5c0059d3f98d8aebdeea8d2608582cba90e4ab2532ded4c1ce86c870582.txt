Human rights activists in the Coast Region have criticized the government for failing to disburse funds to county governments in time.

According to Zedekiah Adika, the chairperson of the Coast Civil society, the move derails the effective performance of devolved governments.

“One thing that is coming out clear is that the national government has failed to disburse money to county governments,” he said.

Adika further noted that some county government employees have not received their salaries for nearly three months.

“It is worrying that some of the county government’s employees have not been paid their salaries.” He noted.

Meanwhile he commended the Mombasa County government for fulfilling the recommendations of the civil rights lobby groups.

However, the activists have cast doubt on the performance of the national government, saying it has failed to take responsibility for its responsibilities.

Said Adika, “As activists we are greatly worried by the functioning of the national government and the county assembly which is far removed from the citizens.”
