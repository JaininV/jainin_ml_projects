"It's real and it's raw," Wynonna Judd said in a statement. "It's celebration and sadness. It's all of the people who I leaned on during one of the toughest seasons of my life.

"I wanted the opportunity to tell my story in my voice. If doing so helps one person out there choose life, then I am grateful."

Wynonna's sister, actor Ashley Judd, has also written and spoken out about mental health struggles in the Judd family.
