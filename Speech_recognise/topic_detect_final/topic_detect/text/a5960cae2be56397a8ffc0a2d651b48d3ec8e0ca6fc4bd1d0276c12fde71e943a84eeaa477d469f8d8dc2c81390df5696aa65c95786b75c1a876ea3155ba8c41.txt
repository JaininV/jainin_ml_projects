A new report by Henley & Partners has revealed that Singapore is now the fifth wealthiest country in the world by the number of millionaires (US$) within its population.

The list published by investment migration consultancy Henley & Partners showed that in 2022, Singapore was home to approximately 240,100 individuals with a net worth of at least US$1 million, also known as High-Net-Worth Individuals (HNWIs).

This number came alongside a huge growth in the number of HNWIs in the country, which stood at 40 percent from 2021 to 2022.

This was enough for Singapore to place it above the likes of Los Angeles, Hong Kong, Beijing, and Shanghai, while the only four cities ahead of it were New York City, Tokyo, The Bay Area, and London.

Singapore also had a substantial amount of extremely rich individuals, boasting a total of 329 centi-millionaires (those with a net worth of at least US$100 million) and 27 billionaires (US$).

These new statistics seemingly confirm previous forecasts that projected Singapore to see more and more of its population achieve millionaire status within the next half decade.

In 2021, around 7.5 percent of its population total (both citizens and permanent residents) fell into the millionaire category, while it's estimated that that figure will rise to 13.4 percent by 2030.
