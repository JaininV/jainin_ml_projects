The Daily Telegraph’s David Riccio has slammed St George Illawarra Dragons’ decision to call a board meeting to discuss potential replacements for coach Anthony Griffin.

Griffin was told by the Dragons board that they would be reviewing the coaching position earlier in the season and it has been revealed a board meeting is scheduled for next week to determine a shortlist of coaching candidates.

Riccio said the cloud over Griffin’s job and the uncertainty over who replaces him is causing severe unrest to the players and supporters.

“(Nobody knows) where the club is heading and that’s an answer that no one at the Dragons can state at the moment,” Riccio said on SEN 1170 Breakfast.

“They don’t know if Anthony Griffin will be there beyond this season and they don’t know who will be coming in if he is gone.

“A shortlist of candidates will be determined, that shortlist will be interviewed and from that interview process, a head coach will be drawn from there.

“We are several weeks away from getting an answer at St George Illawarra.

“It’s death by 1000 cuts and it’s weak leadership with low football IQ to have an inability to identify what your club needs, what you want to stand for and who the best fit of your club is.

“At this point, it’s tortuous and it’s a complete waste of a season.”

The names that have been floated as Griffin’s possible replacement include Jason Ryles, Shane Flanagan, Ben Hornby and even Des Hasler.

However, Riccio said there is no way of determining a favourite to overtake Griffin due to how split the current Dragons board are.

“I have no faith in the current management structure or decision making at the Saints.

“There are two sides to the club, a St George side and an Illawarra side and both sides are not on the same page.

“To the point where I know Illawarra wants a certain coach down there and St George dont.”

The Dragons play the Canberra Raiders on Sunday.
