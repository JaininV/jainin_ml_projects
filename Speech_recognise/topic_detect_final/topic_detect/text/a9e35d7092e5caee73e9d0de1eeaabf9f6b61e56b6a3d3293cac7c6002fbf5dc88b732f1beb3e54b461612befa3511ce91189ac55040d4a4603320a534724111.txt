Hello /co/, I come from the future and I have some news for you!

It’s about Ms. /co/. The final three will be Nia from I can’t sleep, Scary Girl from Total Drama, and Luz from /co/‘s favorite show, Owl House. Scary girl will come extremely close to getting the champ, only for Luz to be the ultimate winrar by a long shot.

See you guys then!Fuck you your timeline is shit man.>>136748702

This shit isn’t going to even happen because of spazzes like you and everyone about to post ITTWill Peridot be banned from Ms /co/ thanks to the spammer?>>136748753

She’s qualified for a while, but the spammer becomes a faggot about it so she gets banned, causing him to spam the threads with BBC calling the Jannies trannies getting banned himself How will Tiff Crust perform in the upcoming Ms /co/?I recall Luz tends to get eliminated fairly quickly, presumably out of spite for Lumity.>>136749019

Yeah I can't see her going for even with the pity votes. Dr. Girlfriend made it far because her show is fairly popular around here.>>136748702

Really? Scary Girl? That's your prediction for top 3? I can see her getting into the tournament but I doubt enough people care about the new total drama to really vote for her to get that far, especially as she looks pretty generic for a goth girl.>>136748955

You say you’re from the future yet you do not know the past
