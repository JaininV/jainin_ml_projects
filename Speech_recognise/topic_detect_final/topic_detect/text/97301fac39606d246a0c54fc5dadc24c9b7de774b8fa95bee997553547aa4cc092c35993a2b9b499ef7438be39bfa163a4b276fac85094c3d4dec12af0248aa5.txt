Serie A: I kept it to myself - Pogba reveals reason for injuries

Former Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba said that the Â£11 million extortion case has had a negative impact on his football.

The Juventus star said his injuries are all down to the case as he was mentally affected after being threatened at gunpoint.

Pogba told L'Equipe that he can no longer concentrate on himself and his football since the incident, which, according to him, affected his body and is the main reason behind the injuries.

"I kept all of this to myself for a long time and then I revealed it. This case has had a big impact on my body, especially on my injuries. I've spoken about it with the French national team manager," he said.

The France international has not played the majority of the season since leaving Manchester United for the Serie A giants.
