Prince Harry’s recollection in ‘Spare’ of his father not comforting him after Princess Diana’s death is probably not representative of their “entire relationship”, says Hello! Magazine Royal Editor Emily Nash.

Prince Harry wrote in his book: “Pa didn’t hug me. He wasn’t great at showing emotions under normal circumstances, how can he be expected to show them in such a crisis?”

“I think that this one instance that has been recalled by Harry in the book is maybe not representative of the entire relationship,” Ms Nash said.
