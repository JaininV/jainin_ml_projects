Chelsea defender Thiago Silva, who signed a one-year deal at the club in February, may have played in his last Champions League campaign thanks to Chelsea’s pitiful 11th-placed standing in the league.

Thiago Silva will turn 39 in September and the next season might be his last for Chelsea and it means this season could be his last playing Champions League football.

Thiago Silva told TNT Sports: “It might have been my last match in the Champions League. I have only one year left on my contract and my career is reaching the end. It’s a very sad day.

“But I think we must continue working to try to win as many matches until the end of the season.”
