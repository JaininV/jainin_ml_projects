Goals from Nicolo Barella and Romelu Lukaku gave the Serie A side a 2-0 win in Portugal and ensured they are well on track to make it into the last-four of the competition for the first time since they lifted the trophy in 2010.

Benfica, who have lost their last three matches in all competitions, have a mountain to climb at the Giuseppe Meazza if they are to prevent an all-Italian semi-final.

The Giuseppe Meazza in Milan will host the match.

TV channel: In the UK, the game will be televised live on BT Sport 2, with coverage beginning at 7.15pm BST.

Milan Skriniar is out for Inter and his fellow centre-back Stefan de Vrij could join him on the sidelines, after being forced off with injury over the weekend against Monza.

Lukaku started on the bench in Portugal, behind Edin Dzeko and Lautaro Martinez, but will be hoping his goalscoring cameo was enough to him a place in the side from the off this time.

Nicolas Otamendi missed the first leg for Benfica through suspension, but is back and available for the trip to Italy and can be expected to start in the centre of defence.

Alexander Bah is set to miss out once again, as is Julian Draxler who has not played since the start of February and is expected to miss the rest of the season with an ankle injury.

Benfica will have to throw caution to the wind at some point in the match, and that will leave plenty of space for the likes of Lukaku to exploit, regardless of whether he starts or not.

Inter are not in particularly good form, that first-leg win their only victory in their last eight matches, but with a two-goal advantage to defend, they can be expected to do enough and book their place in the semi-finals.
