Some U. K. women are defying the trend of lower female representation in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) compared to men by becoming programmers.

The U. K. Office for National Statistics estimated 15,000 more women in Britain were working as coders and software developers in 2022 compared to 2021, while the ranks of female Web designers swelled by nearly 10,000.

The female-founded Code First Girls social enterprise offers free coding courses to women, and connects companies with newly trained female developers.

Code First Girls' Anna Brailford says women should be offered the opportunity to dispel stereotypical perceptions of STEM careers, and such individuals "come with a wealth of experience to change things in technology for the better."
