Sika AG’s sales fell slightly in the first quarter amid a weaker performance in its European markets, it said Tuesday.

The Swiss specialty-chemicals company made 2.33 billion Swiss francs ($2.59 billion) in first-quarter sales compared with CHF2.40 billion in the first three months of last year. That compares with the average expectation of CHF2.41 billion according to a poll of analysts by FactSet.
