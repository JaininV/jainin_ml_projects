Westford USA, April  18, 2023  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- SkyQuest projects that the Magnetic Flowmeter market will attain a value of USD 12.91 billion by 2030, with a CAGR of 5.7% over the forecast (2022-2030). Mechanical flow measuring equipment has high maintenance costs, low precision and requires frequent calibration for different types of liquids. Magnetic flowmeters aid mechanical measuring systems in overcoming these challenges. Magnetic flowmeters can measure thick sludge and fluid because they have no moving parts. Magnetic flowmeters are also equipped with abrasion- and corrosion-resistant liners, making them extremely efficient in measuring erosive fluids, slurry, and most acid and base types. Furthermore, magnetic flowmeters require little calibration and can assess liquid properties with high precision. The high precision of magnetic flowmeters is increasing their popularity in the process industry and leading to increased adoption, which will benefit the Magnetic Flowmeter industry over the forecast period.

According to the SkyQuest's, Magnetic Flowmeter have made numerous advancements in recent years, including wireless connectivity and compatibility with smart devices. Despite some limitations due to non-conductive fluids, electromagnetic induction technology is an excellent choice for measuring liquid flow. Magnetic Flowmeters are becoming increasingly popular in irrigational applications. Magnetic Flowmeters outperform other flowmeters in terms of accuracy and repeatability over the course of their operation.

Magnetic flowmeters are becoming more popular in irrigation applications. They are free of wear and tear and do not require upstream strainers to filter out sediments because there are no moving parts. For Instance, Ceramic linings are used to provide additional protection against abrasive flows. Magnetic flowmeters help to reduce metre piping, which reduces installation time and cost.
