Then, the party elected Danielle Smith as leader and premier.  Only a few months later, several members of the party’s governing board were replaced. Those were more institutional sorts. Their replacements: More fervent upstarts who, largely, belong to the wing of the party that supports Smith.  In both instances, a group called Take Back Alberta (TBA) was instrumental. Now, they’re travelling the province firing up prospective voters and working to get friendly candidates nominated to run in the upcoming election.  So, what is Take Back Alberta? The National Post’s Tyler Dawson explains.

When was Take Back Alberta formed?  Take Back Alberta was formed in 2022. It came together around the time that the United Conservatives were looking at turfing then-premier Kenney.  It was a time when a number of issues were coming together: There was Kenney himself (and his personality) and the sense that his government hadn’t fought back hard enough against the federal government. There was the angst about pandemic public-health measures. And, there was the Freedom Convoy protest in Ottawa, and the border blockade in Coutts, Alta.  All these things came together to create a group of people who were willing to agitate to eliminate Kenney.  Indeed, David Parker, the head of the organization, said on a podcast that “the reason I am going after Jason Kenney is because he arrested pastors.”

“And I said that I would go after Jason Kenney, and I am a man of my word, that I would not rest until he wasn’t premier anymore,” Parker said.  Take Back Alberta is registered as a third party advertiser. This means they can oppose or support any candidate or party and advocate on policy issues.  What does Take Back Alberta stand for?  Those involved in the organization tend to describe it as “pro-freedom.”  It takes credit for ousting Kenney. “Now, TBA has set its sights on stopping the NDP and derailing Rachel Notley’s destructive socialist agenda,” its website reads.  On its Telegram channel, most of the conversation is run-of-the-mill right-wing chatter, although only a few people appear to have posting privileges in the channel. Its Facebook page has similar content, though with comments from more people.

There are a variety of memes in the Facebook page comments (NDP leader Rachel Notley’s face photoshopped on a defecating dog, for example) and some discussions of issues such as 15-minute cities and fears about using electronic vote tabulators.  Who are the members?  This is where things get a little bit more complicated. A recent PressProgress article described them as “Christian nationalists” and “Wexit supporters.”  The grievances that animated other protest groups (the yellow vest protests, the Wexiters, to name but two from recent years) are certainly encapsulated in Take Back Alberta’s ethos to some extent. And there is a fairly clear religious element among at least some who support the movement.  Roy Beyer, the Calgary representative for Take Back Alberta, has described Alberta as “ground zero” in the fight for freedoms. “Freedom is a fundamental Christian value,” Beyer said. “God gave us the gift of freedom, and that gift is being ripped out of our hands.”

A number of the group’s regional representatives have been active in right-wing circles for some time. Parker worked for former prime minister Stephen Harper, for example. Vince Byfield, the Edmonton representative, is the son of the late Ted Byfield, a conservative publisher.  Marco Van Hugenbois, the group’s chief financial officer, was involved in the Coutts border blockade; he faces charges of mischief over $5,000.  The actual membership of Take Back Alberta isn’t clear. In October 2022, organizers told The Globe and Mail that there were around 30,000 members.  What has Take Back Alberta done?  Setting aside the real influence they had in eliminating Kenney and getting Smith elected, the Take Back Alberta crowd also had a fair bit of success at the UCP’s last annual general meeting.

At the convention, Take Back Alberta said it had between 800 and 900 members of its group in attendance.  Nine seats on the party’s board of directors were up for replacement at the convention, and all of the eventual winners had TBA’s endorsement, although their degree of affiliation with the group varies.  It remains to be seen what influence the group will have in animating voters in the upcoming Alberta election.  The group is canvassing the province, holding rallies about the conservative movement and how to win the election.  Already, it is involved in nomination battles. They have posted on social media in support of Red Deer MLA Jason Stephan’s nomination. They’ve also actively sought to take over constituency association boards, which could open the door to contested nominations against candidates — notably Jason Nixon, who was Kenney’s closest deputy.

That said, its policy positions — insofar as they exist — are not especially clear, nor, in many ways, are they all that different from those held by other Alberta conservatives.  What are the criticisms?  The main criticism is that TBA is chock full of extremists. Critics point to some of the people involved and their views, such as conspiracy theories involving the Great Reset, vaccines and “globalism.”  In an editorial in the Crowsnest Pass Herald, publisher Lisa Sygutek, who describes herself as someone who’s been a “card-carrying conservative my entire adult life,” wrote that she’s sad “that my party is fractured by an extreme right conservative group and people like me who are moderate are left bereft.”  “It was bizarre. There was honestly a sense of extreme hostility in the room. It felt like a coup,” she wrote.  Supporters, meanwhile, brush this off.  “Remember, as the media continues to paint us as radical, that also gets our message out,” Parker wrote on Telegram recently.  In another post, he said the attacks mean the group is “beginning to be successful in our efforts to wake up regular Albertans to how they can shape their own society.”  Take Back Alberta did not respond to the National Post’s request for an interview with Parker.
