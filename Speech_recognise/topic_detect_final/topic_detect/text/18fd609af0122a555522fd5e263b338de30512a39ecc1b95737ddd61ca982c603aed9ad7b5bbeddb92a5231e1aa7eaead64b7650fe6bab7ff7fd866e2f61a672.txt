What do Barbadians think about introducing casino gambling as a means of boosting tourism?

Most of them who spoke with CBC News seemed to be in favour of the move.

This is after Minister of Tourism and International Transport, Ian Gooding-Edghill, shared his personal support of Barbados embracing casino gambling on Q100.7FM’s “Let’s Talk About It”.

Meanwhile, the church is one of the institutions with an initial reaction to the Minister. It is maintaining its position against its introduction.

That is the view of the Bishop of Barbados, the Most Reverend Michael Maxwell.

The issue is one that the Barbados Hotel And Tourism Association Chairman, Renee Coppin, says she will raise with her membership to assess their mood before making an official comment.
