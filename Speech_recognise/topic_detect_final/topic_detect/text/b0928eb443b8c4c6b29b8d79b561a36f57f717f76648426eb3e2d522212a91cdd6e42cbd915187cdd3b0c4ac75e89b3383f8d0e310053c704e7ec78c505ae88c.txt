CACAPON, W. Va. — Could a destination RV Camp be coming to Cacapon Resort State Park?

The West Virginia DNR submitted a Request for Proposals to possible vendors in December to seek private investors interested in constructing such a park at the 6,000-acre Morgan County state park.

The Winchester Star reports three companies have submitted proposals, although a vendor has not been selected.

The WVDNR is holding a public hearing on the proposals at 5:30 p.m. Tuesday in the Washington Fairfax Room at the Cacapon lodge.

One proposal, from Blue Water Corporation would put 240 RV camping sites behind the park’s Nature Center, or 350 RV sites north of the northern portion of the Ziler Loop.

According to the Star, a  proposal from River & Trail Outfitters would add about 50 RV camping sites in the Cabin Loop Trail area. The company’s submission includes plans for an Airsoft course and shuttle bus services for mountain bikers.

A proposal from Scenic LLC would establish a 173-site campground at the base of Cacapon Mountain.

Proponents say the project would help make the park more financially self sufficient.

A group of local activists including Cacapon Trails and Friends of Cacapon Resort State Park oppose the proposed RV park addition.

Morgan County commissioners wrote a letter earlier this month to West Virginia Chief of Parks Brad Reed opposing most of the proposals from vendors:
