Numerous shots were fired and four people were injured after a food delivery went wrong on Detroit's west side.

Police officials in Detroit say Deon Thomas of Detroit ordered food, intending to have it delivered to his home on Thursday (4/13), but the food was erroneously delivered to a nearby home.

Thomas then confronted the residents of the home where the food was delivered and the conversation soon escalated. Detroit's WDIV-TV reports that Thomas pulled out a handgun and began firing.

Detroit Police Chief James White says that spawned a shootout, with more than 30 shots being fired between the two homes. Investigators confiscated four guns and questioned 11 people.

Injured in the shootout were a 31-year-old man from Dearborn Heights, a 36-year-old woman from Detroit, and two 14-year-old boys from Detroit. None of the injuries were life-threatening but all four victims and Thomas were taken to area hospitals.

A representative from Cease Fire Detroit tells WJBK-TV in the video below that citizens need to stand up against this type of violence and can't let it become normalized.

"The community needs to understand, this isn't normal," he says. "We shouldn't get used to hearing 'A 14-year-old is dead, a 14-year-old got killed.'"

The representative from Cease Fire goes on to say that it's important for parents to prepare their children and teach them non-violent ways to resolve conflict.
