COLUMBUS GROVE — It would be an understatement to say that 2003 was a good year for Columbus Grove sports.

In the spring of 2003, the Columbus Grove boys track-and-field team won the Division III state title.

In the fall of 2003, Columbus Grove won the Division VI state title in football, defeating Marion Local 28-26 in the championship game.

Jerry Cooper was the head coach for both Columbus Grove track-and-field and football in 2003. Cooper is presently the head football coach at Shawnee.

Those two state championship teams are the only two in school history.

This past Friday, at the Columbus Grove Bulldog (track) Invitational, the 2003 Division III state championship boys track team was honored.

That 2003 track team for Columbus Grove boasted several top-notch athletes.

Blaine Maag notched the lone individual state title for Columbus Grove at the 2003 state track meet.

Maag, then a sophomore, won the state title in the discus with a throw of 175 feet, 4 inches. Teammate Tayt Mayberry placed second (170-5). Maag went on to win the state title in the discus in 2005 as well.

In the shot put, Mayberry placed fourth (53-10) and Maag finished sixth (52-10) at the 2003 state meet.

Columbus Grove’s 400-meter relay (Maag, Trevor Miller, Steve Palte, Ben Stechschulte) placed fourth in a time of 43.61 seconds.

In the 400 meters, Miller placed fourth (49.90).

In the final event on the track at the 2003 state meet, the 1,600 relay, Columbus Grove (Miller, Danny Woods, Taylor Jesko, Stechschulte) came in third with a time of 3:23.45.

Columbus Grove won the 2003 state team title by 13 points. The Bulldogs ended the two-day meet with 42 points, while Old Fort was runner-up with 29 points.

The one individual that really stood out for Columbus Grove that track season was Maag.

Maag went on to coach at the collegiate level. He had stops at the University of Findlay (graduate assistant), Grand Valley State University and Michigan State as an assistant coach. Then most recently, Maag returned to the University of Findlay, where he spent five years, the last four as the head coach. In 2021, he stepped down at the University of Findlay.

At Findlay, Maag coached athletes to seven national championships and had 24 All-American placings.

In high school, Maag’s biggest accomplishment outside of track-and-field was probably his 287 rushing yards and three touchdowns against Marion Local in the 2003 Division VI football championship game.

Blaine’s older brother Blake, won a state title in the discus in 2002.

In the 20-plus years I have covered track-and-field for The Lima News, the 2003 Columbus Grove track team stands out as one of the best I have seen from our area.

The Columbus Grove track program has fed off that very successful 2003 campaign.

In 2007, the Columbus Grove boys track team was state runner-up in Division III.

In 2004, the boys team placed fourth at the Division III state track meet. In 2005, the boys team placed third at the Division III state track meet. Before that historic 2003 state championship team, the 2002 boys team was the Division III state runner-up.

The cupboard is not empty at Columbus Grove.

This past Friday, Columbus Grove won the boys team title at the Columbus Grove Bulldog Invitational. On the girls side, Columbus Grove finished fourth, in a competitive field of teams.

By the way, there is still a Maag throwing on the boys team. Senior Lawson Maag won the discus Friday night with a toss of 167-4. Next school year, Maag will be competing at Ohio State in the discus.

In 2021, Lawson Maag placed sixth in the discus at the Division III state meet. Last season, Maag finished 10th at the state meet.
