New York Blood Drive being held on Monday, April 17th

HAUPPAUGE, NY – New York Blood Center (NYBC) will be partnering with the County of Suffolk and Suffolk County Executive Steve Bellone for a blood drive on Monday, April 17th from 10:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. at the H Lee Dennison Building.

The County of Suffolk has been a key partner of NYBC for more than 25 years, reaching nearly 24,500 donations and impacting more than 73,000 people in need of life-saving blood donations. One blood donation has the ability to save up to three lives. When NYBC announced the first blood emergency of the year in March, the County of Suffolk stepped up to schedule this blood drive and support the blood supply during this critical time. A strong blood supply is essential for the community’s disaster preparedness, in partnership with local hospitals to ensure their needs are met.

"Suffolk is proud to have partnered with the New York Blood Center for more than 25 years, and I want to thank them for their continued support in helping us provide this vital resource to our communities,” said Suffolk County Executive Steve Bellone. “Blood donations are a lifeline for so many people, and I encourage everyone to take part in this upcoming blood drive. Your donation can help save a life and truly make a difference to those in need.”

“We are grateful to Suffolk County and County Executive Steve Bellone for being incredible community partners and for all their contributions to the blood supply throughout the past 25 years,” said Andrea Cefarelli, Senior Vice President at New York Blood Center. “We encourage all residents in Suffolk County to come out, bring a friend and donate blood today. One blood donation has the ability to save up to three lives!”

NYBC has been serving the Suffolk community for nearly 60 years, providing nearly 1 million blood products per year. NYBC is also home to one of the world’s preeminent blood research organizations, the Lindsley F. Kimball Research Institute (LFKRI), which conducts cutting-edge research focused on LFKRI’s ability to translate hematology insights into better health.

Blood donors can give every 56 days, and platelet donors can give twice per month.  The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently lifted eligibility restrictions for individuals who lived in Europe during certain periods of time.
