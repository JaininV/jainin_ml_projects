De Gea has been a vital part of Erik ten Hag‘s side and has featured in nearly every game this season so far, particularly in the Premier League – where he now finds himself joint level at the top in terms of clean sheets with Newcastle United’s Nick Pope.

This is a somewhat remarkable feat given United’s horrendous goal difference for the position they’re in, however, they have managed to sustain a lot of clean sheets thanks to the brilliant partnership of Raphael Varane and Lisandro Martinez – and of course the Spaniard in goal.
