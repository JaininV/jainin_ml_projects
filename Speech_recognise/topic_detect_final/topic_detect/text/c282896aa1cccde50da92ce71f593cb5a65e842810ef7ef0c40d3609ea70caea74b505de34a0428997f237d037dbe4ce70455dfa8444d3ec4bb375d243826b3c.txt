The Ministry of Agriculture will seek an increase in the 2023-2024 National Budget.

Minister for Agriculture Vatimi Rayalu said this while contributing to the debate in Parliament on the “Review Report of the Fiji Rice 2013-2017 Annual Report”.

He said with more funds, they would be able to secure machines to support mechanised farming needs for different activities.

“Ministry of Agriculture already has a farm mechanisation program in its current budget but we will be seeking an increase from the Minister of Finance,” Mr Rayalu said.

“We feel that the amount given is not enough.

“I think the Minister of Finance will vouch for this because most of the rice in Fiji is grown in his area, in the North.”

He said the ministry would also embark on exchange programs to enhance farming skills.

“We will include the exchange programs and the provision of technical expertise in collaboration with our development partners.”

He said he met the Deputy General Secretary of one of the provinces in China and it was part of their discussions.

Mr Rayalu said they were also looking at providing farmers with a practical hands-on training on rice production methods and techniques.

“Another one is the promotion of rice cultivation through establishment of local farms field school to facilitate dissemination of information to new farmers.

“This is an important activity because it provides our farmers with a practical hands-on training on rice production methods and techniques and opens up their knowledge and skills to better methods of rice cultivation.”
