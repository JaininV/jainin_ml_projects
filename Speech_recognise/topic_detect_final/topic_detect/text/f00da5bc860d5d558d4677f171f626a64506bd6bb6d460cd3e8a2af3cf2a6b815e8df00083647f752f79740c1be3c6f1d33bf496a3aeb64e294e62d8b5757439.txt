Speaking to host Tucker Carlson on Fox News after he claimed that the urge to have sex and procreate has been “subverted” by contraception, he said: “In the past, we could rely upon simple limbic system rewards in order to procreate but once you have birth control and abortions and whatnot, now you can still satisfy the limbic instinct but not to procreate.

“So we haven’t yet evolved to deal with that because this is all fairly recent in the last 50 years or so, with birth control.  The Tesla founder  — who is the second richest man in the world with a reported net worth of $189.2 billion — went on to insist that unless more children are born in an effort to “sustain” or even “increase” population numbers, civilization is on track for a “depressing end” full of overgrown adults.  He said: “If we don’t make enough people to sustain our numbers or perhaps increase a little bit then civilization is going to crumble. Will civilization end with a bang or whimper? Well, it’s currently trending to end with a whimper in adult diapers, which is depressing as hell.”  Elon previously urged people to have more children when he bemoaned the “population crisis”.  He told the audience at a 2021 Wall Street Journal event: “I can’t emphasize this enough, there are not enough people.”  Despite the billionaire businessman’s comments, there were around 3.9 billion people alive when he was born in 1972, but the human population is expected to pass 8 billion this year.
