The U. S. Drug Enforcement Agency’s (DEA) National Drug Take Back Day is coming up this weekend, and area law enforcement agencies are encouraging residents to participate. On Saturday, April 22, Iowans can deposit any expired, unused, or unneeded medications at disposal sites located throughout the listening area. The goal is to prevent the misuse and abuse of these medications, which can be dangerous and even deadly. Local departments are not hosting special collection events on Saturday, but most counties have at least one prescription drug drop-off box available to the public during regular business hours. In Carroll County, participants can deposit their medications into the secure box at the Carroll County Sheriff’s Office. Sac County’s, Audubon County’s, and Guthrie County’s drop-off sites are located in their respective courthouses. In Greene County, residents can bring unused drugs to the Greene County Law Enforcement Center. Since 2010, the DEA and its law enforcement partners have collected nearly 16 million pounds of unneeded prescription medications. Visit www.dea.gov/takebackday to find an alternative site near you.
