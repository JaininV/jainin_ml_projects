Fans are already raving about Metallica’s just-released new album, 72 Seasons. Guitarist Kirk Hammett spoke to Guitar World magazine and gave a track-by-track breakdown of the entire set for fans.

When discussing the tune “Chasing Light,” Hammett revealed his love and deference to his early inspirations: “Players like Jimmy Page mean so much to me, so I was definitely tapping into that. It’s gonna be a sad day for me when he’s gone. I hate to bring up Jeff Beck’s passing, but it hit me hard. I had a relationship with Jeff. He was one of my favorite players. I’ve realized that very soon what’s gonna happen is what happened in the ’60s with all the jazz giants who left us. I’m kinda preparing myself mentally for times like that. All I want to do is carry on their legacy through my playing, and you can hear it on this album.”

Regarding the song, “You Must Burn,” Hammett shed light on the power of James Hetfield’s playing and writing: “There’s a melodic riff in there with no singing over it that is so great and so f***in’ beautiful. It’s one that James came up with, and when we first played it I actually said to him, ‘Bro, I think this is one of the greatest riffs you’ve ever written.’ Honestly, it’s the best riff I never wrote. I love it so much and I’m so happy that at least one of us came up with it.”

When we last caught up with Kirk Hammett, he explained all the things he loved and admired about Jimmy Page: [“Jimmy Page has been one of my heroes for years and years and years. He was the man, I mean he was all-encompassing. He was a brilliant songwriter, he was a brilliant musician, he was a brilliant producer, he was a brilliant showman. He had it all. He had a great tone — a great attitude. I mean, what’s not to like about Led Zeppelin?”] SOUNDCUE (:21 OC: . . . about Led Zeppelin)
