After his contract expired in late 2021, former NXT Champion Johnny Gargano left WWE.

He took some time off from wrestling to be a father at home. When he decided to return, he signed a new contract with WWE and made his main roster debut on RAW in 2022.

Gargano was last seen on WWE programming at NXT Stand & Deliver 2023, where he defeated Grayson Waller in an unsanctioned match.

According to Fightful Select, Gargano is currently out of action with a shoulder injury:

“Gargano re-aggravated the shoulder injury that had him sidelined for much of January. After only having a couple of matches his first few weeks back, Gargano ended up wrestling a dozen matches after March 4.

We’re told that the shoulder injury got worse after his Royal Rumble return, and by the time of the NXT match with Grayson Waller he was severely hampered and using one arm.

The hope from the company is that he can repair the injury with physical therapy as opposed to surgery.”

There was some speculation that Gargano is off WWE TV because Vince McMahon (who is making some creative changes as of late) took him RAW because he might not be a fan of this cruiserweight wrestler.

However, that’s not the case. Fightful reports that Vince himself talked with Gargano in 2021 and told him that he wants him to stay with WWE.

Lombardi was under WWF/WWE contract from 1983 until he was released from World Wrestling Entertainment 33 years later, in 2016.

He also portrayed several other characters on WWF TV over the years, such as Kim Chee, The Red Knight, Doink (one of many) & ‘MVP’ Abe “Knuckleball” Schwartz.
