Swire Shipping Fijian Drua head coach Mick Byrne has included 2020 Tokyo Olympics gold medalist Kalione Nasoko in his matchday 23 for Round 9 of the Shop N Save Super Rugby Pacific match against the Chiefs.

It has been a long-awaited appearance on the matchday squad for Nasoko following a series of injuries through the Drua’s inaugural season last year.

He is a potential debut this weekend, providing cover for the midfield backs.

Also making their first starts this season are Haereiti Hetet and Michael Naitokani, while Chris Minimbi makes a first appearance this season on the bench.

Iosefo Masi is not included in the match.

Isoa Nasilasila will run out for his 20th appearance for the Drua this week, to take the outright lead for most Drua appearances.

The Drua are third this season in offloads (80), second in scrums won (88 per cent) and equal first for rucks won (96 per cent).

This is the Drua’s first trip to Hamilton. Both sides have only met once previously in 2022, with the Chiefs winning by a single point (35-34).

The match in Hamilton kicks off at 7.05pm on Friday.
