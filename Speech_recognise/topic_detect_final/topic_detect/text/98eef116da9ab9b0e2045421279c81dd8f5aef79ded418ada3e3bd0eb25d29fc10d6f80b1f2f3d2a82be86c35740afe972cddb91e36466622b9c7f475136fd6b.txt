Kendal-Crosslands Communities (KCC), a not-for-profit Life Plan Community located in Kennett Square, announced Monday that it will transition out of the Kendal System. KCC will continue to operate with the same brand identity and Quaker values under which it was founded 50 years ago.

To ensure a smooth transition, the process will unfold over the next 6 – 9 months.

“For some time, the KCC Board of Directors and Leadership have been carefully evaluating our affiliate relationship with The Kendal Corporation,” said Lisa Marsilio, CEO of KCC. “As an established and well-developed community, we have the unique benefit of engaged residents, resourceful staff members, strong leadership, and committed board members. Together, we can continue to meet the needs of our community.”

The disaffiliation will not impact operations at KCC and will empower the community to maintain self-sufficiency, preserve historical values, and strengthen finances. Marsilio emphasized that the separation from The Kendal Corporation was amicable. “This transition will be seamless for residents and staff,” she said. “Residents will continue to receive the same services by dedicated staff.”

KCC Board Clerk Rick Spackman said the move was consistent with KCC’s culture and history. “As the very first Kendal community in the nation, KCC takes special pride in the Quaker-inspired culture we have created,” he said. “This is a community that has excelled at self-sufficiency and excellence since our inception 50 years ago, and collectively, our vibrant community looks forward to the next 50 years.”

This decision was reached unanimously by the KCC Board of Directors, with support from its leadership teams.
