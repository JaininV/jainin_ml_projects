The large cow horn agave (Agave bovicornuta) in the front yard started to push a flower stalk last fall, but it took a long break over the winter, seemingly in suspended animation. Now that daytime temperatures have warmed up, the flowers are finally continuing their development. It won’t be long before the first flowers open up—maybe another week or ten days.

In addition to the two agaves above, we have two mangaves that are getting ready to flower. The first one is  ‘Black Magic’. It’s one the darkest varieties yet; even the flowers stalk and the emerging flowers are dark purple.
