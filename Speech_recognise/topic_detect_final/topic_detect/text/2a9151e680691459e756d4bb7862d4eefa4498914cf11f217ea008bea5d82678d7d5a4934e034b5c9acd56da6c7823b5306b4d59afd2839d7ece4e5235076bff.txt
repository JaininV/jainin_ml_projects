Regarding the article Council nixes police board appointment, agrees to process that allows diversity (April 5)  I urge council to recognize it’s essential an Indigenous representative be appointed to the board.  There are at least two candidates who identify as Indigenous.  There are many diverse communities which also need greater representation. However, as a nation, we must work harder to achieve meaningful reconciliation with First Nations peoples who are the founding nations of Canada.  No other marginalized group is owed the same debt we owe to Indigenous Peoples in Canada.  So, resolving to appoint an Indigenous representative is indeed fair, and necessary.       Regarding the column Trudeau’s lost LNG opportunity (April 11). Columnist Diane Francis is off base; Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is correct.

Hamilton, through its new mayor, the very experienced politician Andrea Horvath, has declared an emergency because of homeless people and encampments in that city. Does that sound familiar in our city?  London juggles funding and shifts responsibility as the same problem of growing encampments of homeless people befuddle city staff and what real action might resolve this growing problem.  These are real people in need of harm reduction, mental health care and help battling addiction.  Kitchener recently opened a 50 hut village to get some off their streets. Action is underway in other cities, but London seems to flounder year after year as the homeless population grows.  When will we shut down committee meetings and tackle the problem?
