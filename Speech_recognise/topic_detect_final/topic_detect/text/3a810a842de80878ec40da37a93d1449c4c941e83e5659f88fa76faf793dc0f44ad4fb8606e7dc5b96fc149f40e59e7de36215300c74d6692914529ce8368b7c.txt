From discarded kitchen utensils to cast-off farm supplies, these old finds make for one smart workspace.

1. Turn berry baskets into bins: Hung on adhesive plastic hooks, farmers' market produce baskets organize supplies and free up counter space.

2. Turn a spring into a note station: File away papers and gift tags in a colorful compression coil.

3. Turn flower frogs into desk supply organizers: These ceramic and metal ones store pens upright and business cards within reach.

4. Turn a chicken feeder into a spool holder: No need to keep your best-loved twine cooped up in a drawer. A 's feeder holes make a sweet roosting spot for these colorful crafting supplies. (Ours is sitting atop a crate for extra height.)

5. Turn wooden spoons into ribbon wranglers: Hung with drapery rod brackets, this kitchen staple gives order to unruly spools of ribbon.

6. Turn fishing rods into wrapping paper dispensers: Use a handsaw to trim cane fishing poles (or any wooden pole) to desired lengths, then hang with drapery rod brackets.
