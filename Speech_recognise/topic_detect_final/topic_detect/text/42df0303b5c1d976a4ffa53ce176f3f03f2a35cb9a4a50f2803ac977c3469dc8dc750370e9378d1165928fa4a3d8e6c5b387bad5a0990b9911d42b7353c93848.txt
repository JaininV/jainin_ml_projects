UK inflation slowed slightly last month but held stubbornly above 10%, official data showed today, further fuelling a cost-of-living crisis despite an aggressive series of interest-rate hikes.

The consumer price index (CPI) rose by a stronger-than-expected 10.1% in March, down from 10.4% in February, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said in a statement.
