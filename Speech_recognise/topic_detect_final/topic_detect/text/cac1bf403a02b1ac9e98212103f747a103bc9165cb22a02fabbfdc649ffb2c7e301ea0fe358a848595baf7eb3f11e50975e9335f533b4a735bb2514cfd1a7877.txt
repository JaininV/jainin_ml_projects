Ranveer Singh will bounce back with Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s Baiju Bawra says source close to Aditya Chopra

Ranveer Singh will bounce back with Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s Baiju Bawra says source close to Aditya ChopraThere have been some pointedly cruel write-ups and careless whispers on Ranveer Singh’s recent string of flops. All totally out of line. Some have even suggested that Aditya Chopra who discovered Ranveer and worked extensively with him until recently, has decided to keep a distance from the 'Gunday' star after his spate of failures.

However a very close friend of Adi Chopra rubbishes all these cruel claims about Ranveer’s career. “Who says Adi and Yash Raj don’t want to work with Ranveer? Adi loves Ranveer and even today Ranveer doesn’t sign a single project without running it through Adi. Ups and downs do not dictate long-term business associations in this industry. Rajesh Khanna had nine flops but he bounced back with Yash Chopra’s Daag. Ranveer too will be back in a big way with Bhansali’s Baiju Bawra. It will be the biggest hit of Ranveer’s career.”

Adi’s friend also warns of a further whisper campaign against Ranveer. “They will suggest that Ranveer has been thrown out of Baiju Bawra. But Bhansali has made up his mind to work with Ranveer and Alia on that project.”Right arrowUber accused of charging more when passenger’s phone battery is lowUsha Uthup: Dev Anand helped me get into BollywoodFilms that were changed after fan backlashMinka Kelly forgives her mother for her bitter childhoodJanhvi Kapoor and boyfriend Shikhar Pahariya jet off for a summer vacay00:46Guess who helped Amitabh Bachchan when he 'failed' to upload a picture on Instagram?00:56'Beard aati hai aapko,' writes a troll as Rashmika Mandanna posts a picture saying, 'Don’t know how to pout so a straight out kissie it is'00:53Ranbir Kapoor, Alia Bhatt spotted on their first wedding anniversary; ‘Elated’ actor shakes hands with paps01:44Manisha Koirala recalls waking up at '4 in the morning to hike up the hills for two hours' to shoot for song 'Ek Ladki Ko Dekha Toh'01:21Femina Miss India 2023 Grand Finale: Ananya Panday, Bhumi Pednekar and others dazzle at the red carpet01:48Ananya Panday at Femina Miss India 2023 Grand Finale: 'There is more realism in beauty standards'03:58The making and unmaking of dreaded gangster Atiq AhmedIMF paper says India has nearly eliminated extreme povertyMeet Maulana Azad.
