“The message was pretty clear — I want to be a future of this team, I want to play every game and I want to do the best that I can to help the team,” Ruzicka revealed afterward. “It was a great meeting.”  Ruzicka showed plenty of promise in the fall, proving productive during an audition as the left-winger on Calgary’s first line. He scored six goals on the season, all of those during a three-week stretch.

By the time the Flames wrapped a frustrating campaign, the skilled Slovak seemed to be a forgotten man. Before he could pack up his game gear, he may have needed to chase away some dust bunnies.  Amidst all the excitement about the future of forwards Jakob Pelletier and Matt Coronato and rising star goalie Dustin Wolf, Ruzicka is rarely mentioned. He turns 24 next month, so his best hockey should still lie ahead. He has one of the best shots on the team and is signed for another season at the league-minimum salary. While the knock on No. 63 has always been a lack of consistency, there’s not another 6-foot-4 centre knocking on the door for full-time duties with the Flames and these guys aren’t all that easy to find.

“I think everybody got mentally tougher from this season because it was just ups and downs all the time, frustrations, happy times too,” Ruzicka said during Friday’s end-of-season media availability. “Guys got mentally tougher, so I think that’s what you can take from it.  “It was a rollercoaster season. We’d be great and then, all of sudden, we wouldn’t play as good. It was just going up and down. It’s tough to play like that.”             Gilbertson: As Flames wrap frustrating season, Backlund’s pause says it all        It’s tough to not play, too.  Ruzicka totalled 44 appearances in 2022-23, his first full season at the Saddledome.

From Jan. 21 on, he suited up for just eight of the final 35 dates on the calendar, hitting double digits in minutes played in only two of those.  With his team eliminated 48 hours earlier, it certainly raised eyebrows that he remained a scratch for the meaningless finale against the San Jose Sharks. Coronato and Wolf were both tapped that night for their NHL debuts, while Pelletier returned to action after an extended stint in the press box.  “Pretty frustrating, right?” Ruzicka replied when asked to summarize his season. “When I played on the first line, I think I proved that I can do it. Obviously, it’s coaches’ or management’s decision where I play. All I think about is to actually play in the game. I don’t care how much I play. I just want to play.”

As he prepared to head home for the summer, Ruzicka was unsure if he’d represent his country at the upcoming world championship tournament.  But if you figured he’d also be unsure about whether he might be better off in another NHL city, guess again.  “First of all, I was drafted here. It’s the only team I’ve been on so far,” he reasoned. “So the plan is to stick around and be here as long as I can and help the team win. So that was the message. But who knows what is going to happen?”    It’s one of the best nights of the entire year — the opening of the Stanley Cup playoffs.  Unless, of course, you’re one of the guys who was expecting to be part of the action. In that case, there’s far less appeal in parking Monday in front of your flat-screen.  As Flames backup netminder Dan Vladar put it on locker clean-out day: “It’s not going to be a fun couple of months watching other teams play.”  “I’m still a fan of the game, so I’m going to watch as many as I can,” echoed depth defenceman Michael Stone, whose younger brother Mark is expected to return to action for the Vegas Golden Knights after missing the past three months with a back injury. “But you constantly think about that could have been you playing in those games if you would have done this differently or done that better.”
