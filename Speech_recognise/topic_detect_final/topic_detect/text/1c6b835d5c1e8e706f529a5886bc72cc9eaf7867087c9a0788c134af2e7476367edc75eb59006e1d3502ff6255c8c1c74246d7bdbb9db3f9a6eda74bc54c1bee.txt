Stripe has thousands of engineers working across many different product areas. The Service Operations team works with engineers to build tools and solutions to accelerate the development and operations of their software. We have a lot of work to do: in 2023, we must expand our development tooling to cover more use cases and provide users with intuitive experiences for creating and operating their services at scale. We’d love for you to be a part of it. We’re close to the people using our tools and solutions and we are constantly looking for opportunities to improve their experiences.

This particular role seeks a senior engineer focused on the user experience, interface, and product aspects of our infrastructure tooling.

We’re looking for people with a strong background (or interest!) in building tools and solutions to make engineers more effective. We’d love to hear from you whether you’re a seasoned productivity engineer, or whether you’ve just learned you like building for other engineers.
