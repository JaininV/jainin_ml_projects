In favor of Rivers State Governor Nyesom Wike and governor- elect Simi Fubara, the Federal High Court in Abuja has barred the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) from suspending the politicians over alleged anti- party activities. Justice Inyang Edem Ekwo ruled in favor of the politicians on Tuesday, also prohibiting the PDP’ s National Leadership from canceling Fubara’ s membership for similar offenses.

Ekwo stressed that any  governed by law must adhere to due process when dealing with legal issues. These rulings follow two separate lawsuits filed against the PDP. Wike is the leader of the G5 Governors, a group of PDP governors who are dissatisfied with presidential candidate Atiku Abubakar and the party’ s national leadership previously led by Iyorchia Ayu.

The attempt to suspend Wike and cancel Fubara’ s membership is believed to have been motivated by their perceived disloyalty to the party, which could have prevented them from participating in the PDP’ s future activities.

The rulings have been well received by supporters of Wike and Fubara, who viewed the PDP’ s suspension attempt as a politically motivated move to silence the politicians’ voices. The decision is also expected to have a significant impact on the future of the PDP, as it has brought to light the need for the party to follow the proper legal channels in addressing issues related to party discipline.
