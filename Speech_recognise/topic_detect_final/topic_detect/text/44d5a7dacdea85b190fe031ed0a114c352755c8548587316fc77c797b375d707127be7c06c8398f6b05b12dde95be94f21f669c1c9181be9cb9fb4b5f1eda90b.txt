TV presenters want same legal standing as civil and religious ceremonies in England and Wales.

Stephen Fry and Sandi Toksvig are leading calls for the formal recognition of humanist marriages in England and Wales, amid claims their unofficial status discriminates against LGBTQ+ people.

The TV presenters – both humanists – want the justice secretary, Dominic Raab, to follow Scotland, Northern Ireland, Jersey and Guernsey in granting humanist marriages the same legal standing as civil and religious ceremonies. The government has been considering making changes for a decade, but has yet to act.

In a letter to Raab also signed by the chair of the Conservative party’s affiliated LGBTQ+ group, Elena Rose Bunbury, and her Labour and Liberal Democrat equivalents, Fry and Toksvig argue that “legal recognition would have a profound impact”.
