In The Fifth Gospel, by Ian Caldwell, the novelist has it that the Shroud of Turin had traveled from Jerusalem to Edessa, Turkey. Enroute, however, the linen cloth that bears a faint image of the front and back of a man was ensconced in Constantinople. The way the Shroud got to Edessa is most disturbing and a key to understanding the split between the Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic churches. [1]

In our own time, the split between Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox is being played out in Ukraine. The Russian Orthodox church is an autocephalous Eastern Orthodox Christian church, meaning its head bishop does not report to any higher-ranking bishop, such as the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople. [2] Still the Russian church is Eastern Orthodox. Both Russian Orthodox and Greek Orthodox churches celebrated Easter on April 16th this year, while Western Christians did so on April 9th.

In the context of the Russia/Ukraine war the split between Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic can be seen, for example, in Ukraine shelling Donetsk during Easter service on April 16th. “Ukrainian forces targeted central Donetsk with a barrage of rockets in the early hours of Sunday, with several landing near the Spaso-Preobrazhensky Cathedral, forcing an evacuation and disrupting Orthodox Easter celebrations.” [3]

The odd thing is that 72 percent of Ukrainians identify as Eastern Orthodox. [4] Nonetheless Ukraine, in early December 2022, banned the activities of religious organizations “affiliated with centers of influence” in Russia and said it would examine the links between the Ukrainian and Russian Orthodox churches. [5]

In 2014 Patrick J. Buchanan identified Moscow as the Third Rome: “The first Rome was the Holy City and seat of Christianity that fell to Odoacer and his barbarians in 476 A. D. The second Rome was Constantinople, Byzantium, (today’s Istanbul), which fell to the Turks in 1453. The successor city to Byzantium, the Third Rome, the last Rome to the old believers, was — Moscow.” [6]

It was all so long ago, yet it is being played out again. In the Fourth Crusade (1202 – 1204) the stated intent was to recapture the Muslim-controlled city of Jerusalem. However a sequence of economic and political events culminated in the sack of Constantinople, the capital of the Greek Christian-controlled Byzantine Empire. [7] The sack of Constantinople, as portrayed by novelist Ian Caldwell, is when the Sacred Shroud was stolen from the Greek Orthodox and transferred to Edessa. In Caldwell’s imagining, the rift between Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox might be ameliorated if Rome were to come clean about the provenance of the Sacred Shroud. [1]
