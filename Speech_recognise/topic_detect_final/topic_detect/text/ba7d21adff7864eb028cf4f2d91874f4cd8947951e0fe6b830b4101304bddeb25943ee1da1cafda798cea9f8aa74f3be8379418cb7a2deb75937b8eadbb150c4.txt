Author Layah Heilpern says businesses “don’t care” for social justice issues and are running certain advertising campaigns just to “make money”.

“If you do go woke, then yes you will go broke … it’s very clear there is just not an appetite for it, these major companies are so stupid and it really surprises me how they really think there is an appetite for it, there clearly isn’t, they don’t know their audience,” Ms Heilpern told Sky News Australia host Piers Morgan.

“They don’t really care about these social justice issues, they are just doing it to make money, they’re still capitalist at the end of the day, just like all companies that do it, they really don’t care.”
