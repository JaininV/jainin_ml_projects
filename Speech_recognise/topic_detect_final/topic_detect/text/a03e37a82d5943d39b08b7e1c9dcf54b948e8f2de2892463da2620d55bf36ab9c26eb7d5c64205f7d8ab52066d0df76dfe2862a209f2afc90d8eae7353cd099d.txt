Conor McGregor is back, lending his star power to the long-running reality TV show that might well have saved the UFC.

"The Ultimate Fighter" was an instrumental force during the UFC's explosion of popularity in the early 2000s, shining a spotlight on fighters such as Randy Couture, Chuck Liddell, Tito Ortiz and Ken Shamrock, who coached MMA hopefuls in a season-long competition in which the participants shared a house for several weeks.

Over the course of 30 seasons -- all of which can be seen on ESPN+ -- the show has produced several UFC champions: Forrest Griffin, Rashad Evans, Michael Bisping, Kamaru Usman, Robert Whittaker, TJ Dillashaw and Rose Namajunas, as well as stars Nate Diaz, Tony Ferguson and Diego Sanchez. Each season there also is tension between coaches building up to a big fight of their own. Fans get to see it all play out behind the scenes.

The 31st season of "The Ultimate Fighter" features a coaching matchup between former two-division champion McGregor and onetime lightweight title challenger Michael Chandler, a former Bellator champ. When they fight at the conclusion of the season, it will be McGregor's first fight since he broke his leg in July 2021.

This season's TUF competition, which begins airing May 30 on ESPN and ESPN+, is at lightweight and bantamweight.
