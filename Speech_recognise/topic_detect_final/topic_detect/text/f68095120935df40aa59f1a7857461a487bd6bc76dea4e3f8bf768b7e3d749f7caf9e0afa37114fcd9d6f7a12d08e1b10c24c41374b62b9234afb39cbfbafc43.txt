Skincare brand Missha has named actress Elizabeth  as its global ambassador.

In this role, Olsen will be the face of its new 'Beauty is Reality' campaign, which captures daily life and presents the idea that beauty should be affordable and accessible.

The initiative aims to strengthen the brand’s presence as a global brand by promoting its long-established identity in the international market and by further amplifying its best-selling products, available in a new look that embraces the brand's heritage.

The redesigned packaging combines a minimalist, user-friendly design, while the color of each label represents the primary ingredient of each product, adding a sensory touch. The new look will be available in the U. S. as of May 15, on MisshaUS.com.

According to a company release, Olsen, who is well-known for playing the role of Scarlet Witch in  Studios' Avengers films and the TV series WandaVision, was selected for her ambition and intelligence that transcends her beauty and fame, aligning with the campaign message.

"When Missha approached me with an ambassador opportunity, the most important factor was the message the brand wanted to convey,” said Olsen.

"Missha's 'Beauty is Reality' represents an innovative and practical message that I can support. Attaining exceptional quality doesn't necessarily require a hefty price tag. Missha's aim is to create outstanding products that are accessible to everyone, and it's an honor to communicate this value to young women like myself."

Missha is global beauty company Able C&C's top-selling skincare brand. Since its launch in 2000, it has offered effective products at affordable prices. It is currently present in 46 countries and over 37,000 retail locations worldwide.

Able C&C, a Global Top 100 Manufacturer of skincare and beauty products based in Seoul, South Korea, has a portfolio including Stila, Cellapy, and Bodyholic, among others.
