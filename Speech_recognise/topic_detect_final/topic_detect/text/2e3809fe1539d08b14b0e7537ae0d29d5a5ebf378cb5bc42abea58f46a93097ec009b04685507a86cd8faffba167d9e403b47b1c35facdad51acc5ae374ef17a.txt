Joe Cordina is aiming to become a two-time world champion this weekend when he takes on IBF super-featherweight title holder Shavkatdzhon Rakhimov in his home city of Cardiff.

‘Welsh Wizard’ Cordina picked up the IBF strap in stunning fashion last year but was stripped shortly after when an injury meant that he couldn’t defend against Rakhimov. Instead, the Tajikistani fighter claimed the vacant title for himself, beating Manchester’s Zelfa Barrett by knockout. Now these two will finally go head-to-head and we’ll get to see who deserves the belt more.

Here’s everything you need to know about a top night of boxing in Wales.

How To Watch: DAZN. The event is set to get underway at 7pm in the UK, with ringwalks for the main event scheduled for 10pm.

Last Fight: Cordina scored arguably the stoppage of the year in his last fight, obliterating Kenichi Ogawa with a one-punch KO in the second round to pick up the IBF super-featherweight bauble in spectacular fashion in Cardiff last June.
