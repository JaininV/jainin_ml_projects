Millicent Omanga is a victim! She is a whole CAS who just learnt the internets don’t care about who you are, your creed, station in life, if they get any ammo on you, your a$$ is grass and they will enjoy piling on the manure.

We don’t know the full story, all we know is that a video surfaced online purportedly showing her in series of seggsual acts and while Ruto came out to defend her in a hilarious and idiotic attempt to explain away the photos that first surfaced then the video, what is of importance is the fact that there are lessons to learn here.

Actually, one main one: when participating in whatever it is adults do wakipata kutu, whenever sharing your vundamendoz, there are certain rules that must be followed… Actually, Millicent Omanga needed to just follow one rule that even idiots know:

KEEP YOUR PARTNER’S PHONE UNDER YOUR AUTHORITY!

Simple. Case closed. No, really, if you know you’re with a sneaky link, make sure you have their phone so they cannot sneak photos and videos of you. This was a rather foolish error if indeed it is her. But for now all Millicent Omanga can do is take it on the chin and move on.
