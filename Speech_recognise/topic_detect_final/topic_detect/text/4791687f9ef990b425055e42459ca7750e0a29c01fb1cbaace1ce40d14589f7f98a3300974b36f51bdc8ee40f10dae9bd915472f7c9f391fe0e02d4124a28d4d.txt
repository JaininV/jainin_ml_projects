West Ham manager David Moyes' future is very much up in the air at present.

The Hammers are not inclined to move on from Moyes imminently, as they believe he can help them avoid relegation.

However, The Mail also adds that West Ham want to make plans for next season.

They do not see Moyes remaining in charge of the team beyond this season.

Graham Potter is among the managers that West Ham would chase when the season concludes.

However, finding a top coach would be contingent on Moyes keeping the team in the top flight.
