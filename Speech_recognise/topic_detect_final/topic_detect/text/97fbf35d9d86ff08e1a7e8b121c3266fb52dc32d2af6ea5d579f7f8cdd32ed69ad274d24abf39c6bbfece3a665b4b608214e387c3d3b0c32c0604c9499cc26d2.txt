ACCORDING to people with a breeding kink, nothing is naughtier than making babies.

Here we look at what the kink means and how common it is.

A breeding kink is defined as being aroused by the thought of being impregnated or impregnating someone.

This means wanting someone to ejaculate inside you — or wanting to ejaculate inside your partner — without a condom.

It can be either a fantasy or reality, and experienced by any gender.

No, if you have a breeding kink it does not mean you want to actually get pregnant.

While many use some form of birth control, the kink is often more about the risk, intimacy, and potentially dominant/submissive aspects of unprotected sex.

If you are having unprotected sex you should be cautious about STDs and get tested regularly.

Sex expert Gigi Engle shared the psychology behind the breeding kink with Insider, saying: ”A lot of it has to do with the fact that you don’t really want to get pregnant, which makes it really hot in the moment because you’re doing something very dangerous.

"That’s really the erotic charge behind it.”

Sex educator Gigi Engle told the Insider that the breeding kink is a fairly common fetish, considering how most people learn about sex when they're young.

She said: "I think a lot of it comes from the way we were taught about sex education, and this very danger-of-sex mindset, rather than pleasure."
