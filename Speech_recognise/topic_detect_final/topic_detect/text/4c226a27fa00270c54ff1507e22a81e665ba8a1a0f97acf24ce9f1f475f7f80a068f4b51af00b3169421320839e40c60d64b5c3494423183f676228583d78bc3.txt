ORLANDO — Merck’s Keytruda racked up another potential win on Sunday, showing positive results as a first-line treatment for advanced biliary tract cancers, for which there are few good options.

The 1,069-patient trial in metastatic or unresectable biliary tract cancers showed that patients in the Keytruda-chemo arm had a median overall survival of 12.7 months, compared with 10.9 months in those taking a placebo plus chemo. After a median follow-up of 25.6 months, patients treated with Keytruda (also known as pembrolizumab) had a 17% lower risk of death than patients who received just chemotherapy. The results were statistically significant.
