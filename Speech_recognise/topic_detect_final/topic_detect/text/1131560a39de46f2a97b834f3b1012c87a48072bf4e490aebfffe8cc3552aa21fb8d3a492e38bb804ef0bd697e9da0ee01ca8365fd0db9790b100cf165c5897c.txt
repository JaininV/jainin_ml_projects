DFL rep says white kids should ‘feel bad’ about American history

Rep. Athena Hollins, DFL-St. Paul, who is “openly pansexual,” said in an interview that American history should make white kids “feel bad.”

“What I’ve been told when I talk to people is that white kids feel bad about what happened in the past,” Hollins said. “And I said they should. They should feel bad. It was terrible what happened.”
