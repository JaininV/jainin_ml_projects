A difference in opinion over how the Sydney Roosters should attack has led to tension between the family of dumped halfback Sam Walker and the Tricolours’ coaching staff.

Sources with knowledge of the situation, talking on the condition of anonymity, told the Herald that Walker’s family are privately claiming the Roosters don’t play a style of football that suits the young Queenslander’s strengths.

Walker has struggled for form in 2023, culminating in Roosters coach Trent Robinson dumping him to the NSW Cup in favour of a Joseph Manu-Luke Keary combination for this week’s Anzac Day clash against St George Illawarra.

The Walker family has privately raised concerns over the club’s game plan and the influence of halves consultant Cooper Cronk on the style of football Walker is being asked to play.
