NFL prospect Michael Jefferson has been involved in a fatal car crash.

The 23-year-old wide receiver suffered injuries and will have multiple surgeries after a multiple-vehicle car crash in Mobile, Alabama, on Sunday night, according to his agent and an ESPN report.

The details of his injuries are unclear at the moment.

The Alabama Law Enforcement Agency told TMZ  that Jefferson's 2019 Chevrolet Impala was reportedly struck head-on by a 55-year-old man in a 2014 Dodge Charger.

The Charger also collided with a 2008 Nissan Maxima.

The driver of the Dodge Charger was not wearing a seat belt and reportedly was pronounced dead at the scene.

The incident is reportedly under investigation.

Jefferson played for the University of Louisiana-Lafayette, and this past season, he posted 51 catches for 810 receiving yards and seven touchdowns in his senior year.

He began his college career at Alabama State and led the team in receiving for two seasons before transferring to Louisiana.

He participated in the NFL's combine last month in Indianapolis and put up numbers that many experts projected him to be selected in the draft.

Jefferson was measured at six-foot-four, 199 pounds, and ran a 4.56-second 40-yard dash while posting an 11-foot, 1-inch broad jump.

He was projected to be a mid-round pick in this month's draft.
