What is an abandoned cart in Shopify?

The term “abandoned cart” refers to a scenario where a potential customer adds products to their online shopping cart but doesn’t proceed with the purchase. This is a common problem for ecommerce businesses and can result in considerable loss of revenue. The average rate of online shopping cart abandonment is about 66.5%. That’s a substantial amount of untapped revenue! For Shopify business owners, an abandoned shopping cart may be an annoying and expensive problem. But luckily, with the right strategy and tools, businesses can recover a significant portion of those financial losses and increase overall sales.

As an ecommerce business owner, it’s essential to understand why shoppers abandon their carts to develop effective strategies for recovering lost sales. Here are some of the most common reasons:

Unexpected costs: Unexpected costs such as shipping fees, taxes, and other charges are the most common reason shoppers abandon their carts, with 48% of respondents citing this as the main reason for abandoning their cart.Inconvenience of creating an account: Another common reason shoppers abandon their carts is the inconvenience of being required to create an account. According to the same study, 24% of respondents abandoned their carts because they were asked to create an account.Slow delivery: Slow delivery is another reason shoppers abandon their carts. In today’s fast-paced world, customers expect their purchases to arrive quickly. 22% of customers surveyed indicated that delivery speed is essential when making an online purchase.Technical issues: Technical problems such as slow loading times, website errors, or payment processing issues can frustrate customers and cause them to abandon their carts.Lack of trust: Customers may be hesitant to provide personal and financial information to websites that they don’t trust. Social proof, such as customer reviews and ratings, can help build trust and reduce cart abandonment rates.Complicated checkout process: A complicated and lengthy checkout process can be overwhelming for customers and cause them to abandon their carts. Simplifying the checkout process and reducing the number of required steps can improve the customer experience and increase conversion rates.Comparison shopping: Customers may abandon their carts if they find a better deal or more convenient option elsewhere. Competitive pricing and a unique value proposition can help reduce cart abandonment rates and increase customer loyalty.Unsatisfactory return policy: Customers may abandon their carts if they’re unsure about your return policy or feel uncomfortable with the terms. Offering a clear and easy-to-understand return policy can help build trust and encourage customers to complete their purchases.Few payment methods: Customers may abandon their carts if you don’t offer their preferred payment method.

Now that you know why customers abandon their carts, you’re probably wondering what you need to do to prevent it from happening. Here are nine proven ideas that can help you fix Shopify cart abandonment.

1. Remind visitors that they left something in their cartOne of the simplest and most effective ways to recover abandoned carts is to remind visitors that they left something in their cart. This can be done via an email notification or a popup that’s displayed on your ecommerce site when people try to leave.This message should be brief and to the point. Striking a balance between being helpful and assertive is crucial if you don’t want to come off as overly aggressive or unpleasant. Consider using a friendly tone and offering help or support if needed.

As mentioned, shipping costs are a major factor in abandoned checkouts. Offering free shipping can effectively reduce the number of abandoned carts and encourage customers to complete their purchases.Consider setting a minimum threshold for free shipping to encourage customers to add more items to their cart. This can increase the average order value and improve your revenue.

Offering deals that are only available for a limited time is another effective way to recover abandoned shopping carts. This can include discounts, free gifts, or exclusive offers. You can persuade clients to finish their purchase before the bargain ends by fostering a sense of urgency.Adding a visual cue such as a countdown timer can drastically improve results as it offers an additional incentive to act. This can be especially helpful for customers who are unsure about  whether to buy.

If you’d like to offer limited-time deals for your visitors, you can get started with these templates:

Offering to save a user’s cart contents can be a useful technique for customers who aren’t ready to make a purchase yet. By giving customers this choice, you make it simpler for them to return later and finish their transaction. This can be done through a Shopify abandoned cart app, which can automatically save the contents of the cart and send reminders to the customer.In some cases, visitors leave for reasons unrelated to your website: maybe something comes up, or they need to check some information or measurements before making a purchase.Showing a “save cart” option on a popup like in the example below allows visitors to complete their purchases later.

When customers add an item to their cart, they indicate an interest in that product type. Use this information to recommend other products that may be relevant to their interests. This can be done on the cart page with embedded content, through targeted email campaigns, or in an exit-intent popup (like in the example below).

You can boost the possibility that the consumer will purchase by offering customized recommendations. Consider using Shopify apps like OptiMonk to automate this process and improve the effectiveness of your campaigns.

Personalizing offers based on the value of the cart can be a powerful way to incentivize customers to complete their purchases. For example, you could offer a larger discount or free shipping for high-value carts. This may improve the likelihood that the customer will buy something by making them feel valued and appreciated. In the example below, cart abandoners with cart values between £25-79 are offered a 10% discount:

But someone with a cart value greater than £79 will get the opportunity to save 20%:

Sending abandoned cart emails is one of the most effective ways to recover lost sales. These emails should include a reminder about the items in the cart, a call-to-action to complete the checkout process, and possibly a discount or other incentive to encourage the customer to complete the purchase. You can use a third-party app like Klaviyo to create customized abandoned cart email templates with attention-grabbing subject lines. Alternatively, you can use Shopify’s built-in abandoned cart email feature to automate this process.

Remarketing ads can be directed toward users who’ve been to your website, placed things in their carts, and then abandoned them.To develop customized ads that remind customers about the things they left behind and nudge them to finish their purchase, consider utilizing Shopify’s built-in remarketing tool or third-party platforms like Google Advertising or Facebook Ads to target visitors with your ads while they’re checking their newsfeed, reading their email, or browsing other websites.When creating remarketing ads, it’s important to use eye-catching visuals, clear and concise copy, and a strong call-to-action. Consider creating a sense of urgency or scarcity to encourage customers to take action, perhaps by including a limited-time offer or mentioning that the product is in high demand.

Some of your visitors may be abandoning their carts because of a bad user experience. But you’ll never know what to change if you don’t ask! So why not start collecting feedback from your customers?Surveying abandoning visitors may not stop cart abandonment in the short term, but it will help prevent abandonment in the future.
