Original equipment manufacturers are widely developing an electric vehicle design-to-cost approach for the electric vehicle powertrain simulation, and this trend was generally produced in second-generation electronic vehicles. The DTC approach concentrates on major factors like component integration in the e-powertrain and smarter use of light weighted materials in the structural parts. The manufacturers are concentrating on developing native platforms for electric vehicles. Non-native electric vehicles limit in energy capacity, while native electric vehicles have optimized battery packaging and larger interior space. Hence, manufacturers are undertaking huge investments in these areas. This will have a good impact on the growth of the market.

Particularly in emerging countries, the continuous surges in fuel prices and environmental concerns result in a huge shift of customers towards electric mobility solutions. Therefore, auto manufacturers have concentrated on the development of compact and lightweight e-powertrain solutions, which are helpful for daily transportation. Furthermore, several government policies, the mass adoption of electric vehicles, and incentives for government support are estimated to increase market growth.

Asia Pacific held the largest revenue share of 57% of the market. The automobile manufacturers in these regions are the countries such as South Korea, China, India, and Japan. Emissions norms, as well as stringent government regulations, are the key factors that will likely solve the global warming problem. This is projected to cause an upsurge in the growth of the market in Asia-Pacific.

Europe is projected to grow its market at a significant CAGR during the forecast period owing to the presence of original equipment manufacturers in the market. Numerous countries like Sweden, Norway, Netherlands, and France have observed the huge implementation of electronic vehicles. This will likely enhance the growth of the market in Europe.

Many international electric vehicle manufacturers are investing and increasing their production units in numerous regions. Magna International Inc. declared its expansion in Slovakia, Europe, in August 2020. The company introduced the construction of a manufacturing facility in Slovakia to develop powertrain metal-forming solutions.

Rising carbon emissions levels from various automobiles lead to severe depletion of the quality of air, which rigorously affects human health as well as the environment. Therefore, around the globe, several government bodies have applied several stringent regulations on automotive manufacturers. These factors have influenced manufacturers to deliver cost-effective substitutions for customers by increasing R&D for electric vehicles, and this has propelled the growth of the market.

Procurement of battery elements is a major factor that reduces the implementation of electric vehicles worldwide. Cobalt and lithium are the major elements of the Battery and are available in a few regions. Lithium was obtained in Latin America, China, and Australia. However, cobalt is generally found in DRC. It is hard to procure these elements. Additionally, numerous government norms that control the supply chain and transportation costs made it hard to procure the elements. Furthermore, it is challenging to make a battery cost-effective and high performing, and this resulted in less attractive and costlier electric vehicle production.

The key players in the market are emerging electric care as it is gaining huge popularity. Many traditional car companies are investing in the production of electric cars due to the huge profit in the market, and this will result in the growth of the global electric powertrain market. Likewise, the strict emission rules, increasing prices of fuel, and increasing sales of electric cars awareness regarding the environment will increase market expansion. For instance, Renault group and Bosch car companies have taken the initiative to concentrate on adding electrified vehicles in their product lines and implement vehicle electrification. This is likely to enhance the demand for vehicle electrification.

The BEV segment held the largest revenue share of over 72% due to the increased sales of ICE vehicles and the restriction on CO2 targets. BEV stands for battery electric vehicle. It needs to be plugged into a power source to charge because it is a vehicle that is charged completely by electric energy. Additionally, the reduction in prices of Lithium-ion batteries and innovations in battery technology was projected to drive the demand for BEVs during the forecast period 2023-2032.

48V MHEV was likely to have the largest share of 39% of the market. MHEV stands for a mild hybrid electric vehicle during the forecast period. The growth of the segment was driven because of the restrictions on CO2 targets and the reduction in diesel-powered vehicles. The high adoption of mild hybrids in place of BEVs is an effective solution to decrease emissions, as per the emission analytics. Similarly, the easy addition of a 48V MHEV powertrain into a current ICE vehicle architecture has grown the market in mild hybrid vehicles. Moreover, the expansion of Lithium-ion batteries, along with cost reduction, has enhanced the MHEV powertrain segment market.
