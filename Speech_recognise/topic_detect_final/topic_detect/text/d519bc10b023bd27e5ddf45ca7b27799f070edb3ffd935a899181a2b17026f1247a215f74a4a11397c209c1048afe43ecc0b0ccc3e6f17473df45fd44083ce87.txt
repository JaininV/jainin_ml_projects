One of the ways Aldi keeps its prices on the low side is by limiting its product range and favoring store brands, but the store does carry a certain number of name-brand items. One of these, Jiffy cornbread mix, is something that many shoppers may have come to depend on. After all, this stuff is super-versatile. Not only can you use it to make cornbread or corn muffins, but with a few tweaks and add-ins it can be turned into anything from corn casserole to homemade tamale pie.

While Jiffy corn muffin mix is still listed on Aldi's website, sometimes locating these items in stores can be a bit of a hit-or-miss experience. Aldi does not seem to make a generic cornbread mix, but one Redditor posted on r/aldi to announce their new find: Martha White cornbread mix, which is another item that Aldi lists among its regular name-brand offerings. Well, new to them, perhaps. Martha White (who was a real person before lending her name to a company) has been in the mix-making business since 1899, while those upstarts at Jiffy have only been around since 1901.
