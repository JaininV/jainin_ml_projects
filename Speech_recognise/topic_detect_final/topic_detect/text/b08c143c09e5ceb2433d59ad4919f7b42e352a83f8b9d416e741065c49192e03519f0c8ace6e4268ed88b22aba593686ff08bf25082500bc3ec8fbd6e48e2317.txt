As Hello! magazine points out, Markle was included in the booklet even though she isn’t attending the coronation. Her appearance came in the form of a family photo that was taken in honor of King Charles’s 70th birthday in 2018.

The pic features the monarch and his wife, Camilla Parker Bowles (75), sitting on a bench with two of their grandchildren, Prince George (9) and Princess Charlotte (7). Prince Harry (38) and Markle (41) are standing behind them, along with Prince William (40), Kate Middleton (41) and Prince Louis (4).
