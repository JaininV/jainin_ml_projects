The Federal High Court, Abuja has fixed May 30 and 31 for the continuation of the trial of Ali Bello and three others over an alleged N3bn fraud charge filed against them by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission.

During Tuesdayâ€™s proceeding, the prosecution, led by Rotimi Oyedepo SAN, called their first witness, Nicholas Oyemomoni from the American International School, Abuja.

The witness could not, however, complete his testimony as the defence team, led by Abubakar Aliyu, SAN, objected to the documents that the EFCC sought to tender in evidence through the witness.

He prayed the court to allow him to object to the final written address while admitting the documents provisionally.

But counsel for the prosecution, Rotimi Oyedepo, SAN, argued that the documents could not be provisionally admitted.

Aliyu, therefore, prayed to the court to allow him to address his point of objection to the documents before they would be admitted in evidence.

He prayed the court to allow him to argue his objection at the next adjourned date.

Consequently, Justice Obiora Egwuatu adjourned the matter to May 30 and 31, 2023 for the continuation of trial.

Earlier in February, the court had granted bail to Ali Bello, alongside three others, in the sum of N500 million.
