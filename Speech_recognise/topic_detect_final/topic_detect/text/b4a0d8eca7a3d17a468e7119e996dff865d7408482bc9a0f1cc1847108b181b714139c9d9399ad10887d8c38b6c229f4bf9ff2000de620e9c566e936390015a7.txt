BATU PAHAT: The Johor Islamic Religious Council (MAINJ) will collaborate with more shopping centres to diversify spending of the tithe (zakat), endowment (waqf) and fidyah (religious donations) money so that the collection continues to benefit the needy, especially the asnaf (eligible tithe recipients).

State Islamic Religious Affairs Committee chairman Mohd Fared Mohd Khalid said the proposed collaboration included with several supermarkets to help the asnaf people to shop for essential items for the Aidilfitri celebration.

"This year is the first time, we are collaborating with Mydin supermarket, where it is having a mini supermarket programme in the Semerah state constituency to make it easier for the asnaf to shop.

"MAINJ provides vouchers worth RM200 each for 200 asnaf for them to spend on whatever they need for Hari Raya at the mini supermarket," he told Bernama after attending the MyMart@MAINJ programme for the poor in Semerah here, on Tuesday (April 18).

The Semerah assemblyman said the programme with Mydin supermarket would be continued next year by expanding it to other areas.

In another development, Mohd Fared said MAINJ would look into suitable endowment land owned by MAINJ for use as a commercial area, especially for zakat beneficiaries. - Bernama
