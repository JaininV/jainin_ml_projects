Ellis Park, which was the host venue for the iconic 1995 Rugby World Cup final, is one of the most famous sports grounds in South Africa.

However, the crime-infested Doornfontein precinct in which Ellis Park is situated has been increasingly flagged as a reason why fans are turning away from matchday attendance, particularly during games at night.

During a URC round table discussion this week, Matfield acknowledged that the decline of the area surrounding Ellis Park had become a real issue.

“For me, where Ellis Park is situated and where they are training is a big problem… “I don’t think a lot of players want to go and train there.”

Meanwhile, earlier this month, Matfield also posted a video of him visiting the once famous Boet Erasmus Stadium, which is now effectively in ruins.

As he mentions, Matfield made his Test debut at the former home of Eastern Province Rugby in Gqeberha on 30 June 2001 when South Africa beat Italy 60-14.

However, there’s not much left of the old Boet Erasmus Stadium now, with various parts of the ground having been demolished, while the ground has effectively been left in ruin.

The stadium was officially closed in July 2010, with the Eastern Province Rugby Union moving all games to the new Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium. The last match to be played at the stadium was a friendly against the Blue Bulls on 3 July 2010

“Very sad. So many stories, so many legends… nothing here anymore… but time moves on, we’re getting old,” Matfield says in the video.
