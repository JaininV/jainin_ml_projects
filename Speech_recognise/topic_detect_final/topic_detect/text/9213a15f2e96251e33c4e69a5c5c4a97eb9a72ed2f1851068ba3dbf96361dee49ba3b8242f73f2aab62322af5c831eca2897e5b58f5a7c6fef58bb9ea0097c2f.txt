Sports footwear and apparel retail giant  is to move to a new space at Railpen-operated St Anns Shopping Centre in the London suburb of Harrow.

The flagship status store is an upsize from its current location on St Anns Road. The new 4,100 sq ft unit spanning two floors, will be located adjacent to the centre’s main entrance, opening next spring.

It will showcase Foot Locker’s range of its exclusive premium footwear collections, partnering with brands such as ,  and , as well as stocking active-focused clothing and accessories.

Neil Carter, VP for UK & Ireland at Foot Locker, said: “St Anns Shopping Centre has provided us with a fantastic opportunity to create a larger and more prominent store in a key catchment area. It allows us to stock even more of our exclusive ranges that our customers know and love, and sit amongst many other like-minded, leading brands.

“We have been able to forge great relationships with the Harrow community during our time on St Anns Road but this upsize and relocation enables us to continue to evolve and enhance our offering whilst still being a part of a growing scheme outside of London.”

Foot Locker will join a number of recently opened retail brands at the centre, such as , the design-led family lifestyle brand, which opened a 1,700 sq ft unit, and Stag London, which has upsized its position at the centre opposite  to a new 1,600 sq ft unit.

“The openings reinforce the shopping centre’s position as the prime retail destination”, said Maria Averkina, Asset & Development Manager at Railpen.

She added: “The relocation and upsize of Foot Locker is a great way to start the year. Foot Locker will be a great addition to the scheme, and one that will fit seamlessly alongside our other tenants. Our vision is to continue diversifying the destination’s line-up, and the signing of this international brand confidently reaffirms St Ann’s strong, strategic offering for brands targeting Greater London’s desirable catchment area.”
