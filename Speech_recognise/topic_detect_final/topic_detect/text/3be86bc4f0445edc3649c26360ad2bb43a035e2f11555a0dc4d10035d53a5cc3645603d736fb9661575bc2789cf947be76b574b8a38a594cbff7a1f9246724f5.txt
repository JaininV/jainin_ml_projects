Manila, Philippines — The Philippine Council for Industry, Energy and Emerging Technology Research and Development under the Department of Science and Technology (DOST-PCIEERD) announced the revival of its Facebook page on Wednesday after it was hacked earlier this month.

“We couldn’t make this without the help of our partner at Meta. Just in time as we celebrate our anniversary for years of strong collaborations with our partners,” wrote the council in a Facebook post.

With their Facebook page back and running since April 14, DOST-PCIEERD has since launched several of its initiatives including a call for proposals for its Young Innovators Program, a funding initiative for high school student researchers.
