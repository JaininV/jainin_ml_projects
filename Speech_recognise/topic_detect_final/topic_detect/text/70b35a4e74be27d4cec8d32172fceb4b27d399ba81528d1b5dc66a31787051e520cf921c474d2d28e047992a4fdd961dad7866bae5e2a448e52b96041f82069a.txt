The 2023 Chevron Championship, the first LPGA major of the year, kicks off this week in Texas. Here’s everything you need to know to watch the event, including a full Chevron Championship TV schedule, streaming schedule and complete tee times for the first round.

This event has long been the first women’s major on the calendar, but this year it’s going to look very different. That’s because for the first time in tournament history, the Chevron will be held at The Club at Carlton Woods in The Woodlands, Texas, instead of its former home at Mission Hills Country Club in Rancho Mirage, Calif.

One player to look out for this week is Lydia Ko, who has recently returned to the No. 1 ranking and hopes to win this event for the second time, following her first win in 2016, when the tournament was known as the ANA Inspiration.

Defending champion Jennifer Kupcho will do everything she can to go for a repeat, as will last year’s runner-up, Jessica Korda, and her sister Nelly, who is trying to claw her way back to No. 1. Whoever ends up winning on Sunday, they’ll be faced with a daunting decision of whether to keep the Poppie’s Pond tradition alive.

Golf Channel and NBC will provide TV coverage of the Chevron Championship, and streaming coverage of all four rounds is available on Peacock, NBCSports.com, Golfchannel.com and the NBC Sports App.
