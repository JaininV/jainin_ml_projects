In a Kevin Smith inspired twist, I was forced to step up and come into work tonight to cover for one of my guys.

That’s what a leader does: He takes a shotgun to his plans and does the job when no one else is available. Still, I figured I could use the time to write once the check-in rush slows down.

And now it has.

And now I find myself as blocked as Trump after he hosts one of those parties where he serves nothing but McDonald’s to professional athletes. I have no self-confidence left as a writer, even though I’m desperate to finish my latest series.
