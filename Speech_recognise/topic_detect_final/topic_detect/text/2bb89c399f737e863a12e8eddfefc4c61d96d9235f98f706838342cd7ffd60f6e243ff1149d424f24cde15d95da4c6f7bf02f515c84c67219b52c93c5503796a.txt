The line-up is as follows:

The range opens from $50,990 before on-road costs for the Core manual, and stretches to $79,990 before on-road costs for the Aventura.

Volkswagen Australia expects the Style to be the top-selling model. It starts at $66,990 before on-road costs and goes up against the Ford Ranger Sport and Wildtrak, Toyota HiLux SR5 and Rogue and the top spec Isuzu D-MAX X-Terrain and Mazda BT-50 Thunder.

As detailed above, Volkswagen will offer three engines including a 2.0-litre turbo-diesel four cylinder in two states of tune, a 3.0-litre turbo-diesel V6, and a 2.3-litre turbocharged petrol engine.

The Aventura and PanAmericana will be the first Amarok models to arrive locally with the remaining models expected to follow close behind.

Volkswagen has had more than 10,000 expressions of interest for the new Amarok which suggests the dual-cab ute will be hot property at launch.

South Africa is the home of production for the Amarok. Based on this, the carmaker expects to have “good stock” of the new ute from launch.
