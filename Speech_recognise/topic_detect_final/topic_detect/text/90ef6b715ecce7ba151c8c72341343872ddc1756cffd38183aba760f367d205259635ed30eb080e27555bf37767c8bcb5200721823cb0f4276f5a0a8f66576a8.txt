It’s almost one year since the installation and launch of the accessible beach mat on Noosa Main Beach.

“This has brought so much joy to our entire  community,“ said Libby Doherty whose daughter is a regular at Seahorse Nippers.

“My daughter, Daisy, 8, and I worked hard to make this become a reality, bringing it continually to the attention of local and state government. We were so excited to attend the launch and it has been truly life-changing for us. As it is the year of accessible tourism in Queensland, I believe it should be celebrated.“
