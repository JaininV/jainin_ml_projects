NASCAR drivers will have an important challenge over the weekend in the form of Talladega Superspeedway. Denny Hamlin is one of the drivers who is not particularly happy with this race. Hamlin recalled the past results of this race, and emphasized that things are completely different now.

"It’s a much wider race track but we don’t need all that space,” Hamlin said, as quoted by yardbarker.com   “We don’t need all that space… Man, I hate being Denny Downer. Gosh, dang it.

I’m trying to find some positives here but our superspeedway racing isn’t what it used to be three wide, four wide. You know, Dale Earnhardt, I don’t know how many times you’re going to see the Dale Earnhardt comes from 18th to 1st in five f—— laps or whatever it is.

They’re going to keep playing that damn replay."

However, Hamlin emphasized that it is no longer possible to do that.  “Well that’s nice because it’s not able to be done anymore.

It’s just um, we’re going to get in line, there’s going to be an inside line and there’s going to be an outside line. I’m going to be in one of them, and I’m going to just sit right there.

Put on the handcuffs."  The tactics Denny is going to use for this race have been revealed. There is no doubt that this race will be a challenge for everyone. We hope that we will see a quality race this season, and that at the end of the day the best will be able to claim victory.

“The day of building runs, making runs and, it’s just… We’re just going to sit there in I-77 traffic and hopefully, I pick the right line that goes forward. And what happens is whatever line has the third and fourth place guy willing to push more, that line usually prevails”.
