Watch an absurdly cute dog react to a plush toy that looks like a tiny version of him. I like the way that the dog looks slightly surprised by its little doppelganger for a second, and then cuddles up next to it as if they've been lifelong pals. The tiny pooch's resemblance to the big fluffy dog is just perfect. Every dog should have a little plush replica of itself to cuddle with!
