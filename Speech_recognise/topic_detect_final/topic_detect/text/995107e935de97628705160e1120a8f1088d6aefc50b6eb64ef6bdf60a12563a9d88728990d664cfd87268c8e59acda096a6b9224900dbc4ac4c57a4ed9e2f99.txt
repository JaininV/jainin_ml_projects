MMA fighter Sammy-Jo Luxton has been pictured braless in a tiny leather outfit as she celebrated her birthday.

The OnlyFans star was enjoying a night out as she donned the sultry dress.

Luxton, now 24, appeared on the Floyd Mayweather v Aaron Chalmers undercard in February.

The exposure to a wider audience of her fighting ability saw her grow even more popular online.

Her latest photos have certainly caused a splash too as fans flocked to  comment on her birthday pics.

Luxton posed in a black leather outfit where she is noticeably missing a bra.

She stretches her right hands across her chest as she stares alluringly at the camera.

Another snap shows Luxton with a wide smile while sat at a restaurant table.

Fans enjoyed see the stunning fighter let her hair down.

One said: "It's always nice to see you glammed up, knowing you could kick the crap out of everyone in there."

Another said: "You are glowing."

While a third fan added: "You absolute beauty."

Luxton made her name in Muay Thai and has been competing in combat sport since the age of 11.

But the fight on the Mayweather undercard was her boxing debut.
