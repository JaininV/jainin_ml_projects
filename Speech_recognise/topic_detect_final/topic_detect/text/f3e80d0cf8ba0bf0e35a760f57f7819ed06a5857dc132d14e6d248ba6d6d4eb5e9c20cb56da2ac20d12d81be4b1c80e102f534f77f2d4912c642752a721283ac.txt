During a training session today, Inter midfielder Marcelo Brozovic and goalkeeper Andre Onana engaged in a physical altercation ahead of their Champions League quarterfinal second leg against Benfica tomorrow evening. A video of the incident was shared on social media by Italian news outlet Calciomercato.it, showing the two players shoving each other after a challenge by Onana during a training drill.

Tensions were high in anticipation of the match against Benfica, leading to a brief clash between the teammates. The dispute occurred when Onana attempted to win the ball from Brozovic during a rondo exercise, leading to a heated exchange and shoving. Other team members intervened to separate the two players and defuse the situation.

The altercation was short-lived, with Romelu Lukaku calming down Brozovic and Danilo Dâ€™Ambrosio guiding Onana away from the scene. Other players ensured the pair did not reignite their confrontation. Despite being separated, Brozovic seemed frustrated as he kicked a bag into the air while walking away.
