* Alfa Rafiu, a POS operator in Nigeria, received N280 million due to a bank error and went on a spending spree, purchasing houses, cars, and sponsoring people for the lesser Hajj.

Alfa Rafiu, a Point of Sale (POS) operator living in the Akuji compound, Abayawo area in Ilorin West Local Government Area of Kwara State, Nigeria, recently made headlines after a staggering N280 million was mistakenly transferred to his bank account.

How the Money Was Discovered

Around two weeks ago, Rafiu received multiple bank alerts that amounted to a jaw-dropping N280 million. However, instead of alerting the bank to this unexpected transfer, Rafiu decided to keep quiet and capitalize on the windfall.

Once the money was in his account, Rafiu wasted no time in upgrading his lifestyle. He went on a spending spree, purchasing multiple houses and cars.

Rafiu’s generosity extended to his community as he sponsored a number of people to attend the lesser Hajj. Some of these individuals are currently in Saudi Arabia, thanks to Rafiu’s financial support.

While Rafiu’s newfound wealth allowed him to make many people in his community happy, some residents grew suspicious of his sudden fortune. As a POS operator, his income shouldn’t have allowed for such extravagant spending.

As suspicions grew, the bank eventually discovered the error during an audit. Realizing the magnitude of the mistake, they enlisted the help of law enforcement to track down Rafiu.

Police from the “C” Division Police Station, Oja-Oba, Ilorin, accompanied by bank officials, arrested Rafiu on Monday in Ilorin, Kwara State capital. He was later moved to Lagos.

Ajayi Okasanmi (SP), the Police Public Relations Officer (PRO) of the Kwara State Command, confirmed the incident. However, he stated that the arrest was carried out by the Force Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department (FCIID) from Alagbon-Close, Ikoyi, Lagos, which made it beyond the jurisdiction of the Kwara State Police.

While the Kwara State Police were informed of the situation, the FCIID from Alagbon-Close, Ikoyi, Lagos, took charge of the case due to its magnitude and the involvement of the banking sector.

This story serves as a cautionary tale for anyone who might find themselves in a similar situation. While it may be tempting to keep quiet and spend the money, it’s important to remember that honesty is always the best policy. Bank errors will eventually be discovered, and the consequences of taking advantage of such a situation can be severe.
