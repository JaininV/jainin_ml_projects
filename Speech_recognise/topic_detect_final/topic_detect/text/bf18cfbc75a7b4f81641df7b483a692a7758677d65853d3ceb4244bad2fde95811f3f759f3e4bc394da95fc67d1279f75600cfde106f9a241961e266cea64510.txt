There is still no date for the byelection to replace Horgan — who resigned as premier last year and as MLA on March 31 — but it’s clear the race is heating up.  At his launch event in Langford, Parmar was endorsed by Mitzi Dean, the NDP MLA for Esquimalt-Metchosin and minister of children and family development.  Parmar, born in Victoria and raised in Langford, first met Horgan in Grade 5 when the self-described keener was doing a project on the 2005 election.  “He inspired me and he’s been a friend and mentor ever since.”  As a student activist at Belmont Secondary, Parmar led a movement through a petition and student walkout to successfully push the provincial government to replace the aging high school with two new schools.

Parmar, 28, was the youngest school board trustee in the country when he was elected in 2014 at age 20.  Parmar is so far the only NDP nominee. The nomination process closes on May 13.  The B. C. Greens last week announced that Camille Currie, founder of B.C. Health Care Matters, will be their candidate for the riding. The Langford mom and small business owner launched the advocacy group to protest the province’s family doctor shortage.  B.C. United, formerly the B.C. Liberals, have not yet named a candidate but its leader, Kevin Falcon, said that work is underway.  The B.C. Conservative party will announce their candidate next week, said its leader, John Rustad.  Premier David Eby must set a date for the byelection within six months of the seat becoming vacant.
