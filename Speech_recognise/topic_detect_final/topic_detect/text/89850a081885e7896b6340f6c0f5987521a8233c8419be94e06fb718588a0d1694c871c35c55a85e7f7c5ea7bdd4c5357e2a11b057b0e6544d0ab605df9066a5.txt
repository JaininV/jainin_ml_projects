Fellow Sephora rewards members, get your wish lists ready. The Sephora spring sale is finally open to all shoppers—and it’s full of TikTok-viral beauty products like Supergoop’s Glowscreen and Rare Beauty’s Soft Pinch Liquid Blush. Rouge rewards members (those who’ve spent $1,000 or more at Sephora in the past year) have been able to take 20% off sitewide since Friday, but now all other members can officially start saving. VIB members (those who’ve spent $350 or more in the past year) can take 15% off sitewide and Insiders (all other members) can take 10% off sitewide. Everyone should use the same promo code: SAVENOW.

Sephora sales are a great opportunity to stock up on your tried-and-true favorites for less, but they also provide a great excuse to try out the latest cult favorite products while they’re at a discount. Here, we’ve rounded up nine skincare, makeup and haircare products that have been trending on TikTok recently and are all eligible for Sephora’s sitewide discount.
