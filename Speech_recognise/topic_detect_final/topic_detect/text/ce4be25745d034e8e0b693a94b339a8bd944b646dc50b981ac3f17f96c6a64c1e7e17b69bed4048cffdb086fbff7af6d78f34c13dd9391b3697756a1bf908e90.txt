Rhubarb is loved for its sweet yet sharp flavour and unmissable pink colouring, both of which make it the perfect summer fruit.

While the plant will grow easily in the right conditions, caring for rhubarb is more testing during the harvest season.

The flowering and harvest period typically occurs between March and August, during which, gardeners should pay careful attention to how they approach the thick stems.

And when this period (12-14 months) is up, there is one crucial rule that gardeners should always follow.
