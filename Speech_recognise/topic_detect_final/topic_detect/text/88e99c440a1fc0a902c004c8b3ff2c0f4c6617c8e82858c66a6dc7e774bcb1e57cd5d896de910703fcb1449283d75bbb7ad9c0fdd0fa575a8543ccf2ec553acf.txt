On March 10, 1998, Netflix changed the home video game when they snail-mailed out a DVD of Beetlejuice. Since then, over 5 billion DVDs have been sent out to their subscribers. But on September 29th, that is all coming to an end. That is because Netflix announced today that they are ending the service.

Who knew it was still in existence? But it is. And will be for another five months. And then we will be forced to watch movies on our televisions, phones, tablets, and computers via Netflix’s streaming service like we have been doing since 2007.

Netflix Co-CEO Ted Sarandos said, “We feel so privileged to have been able to share movie nights with our DVD members for so long, so proud of what our employees achieved and excited to continue pleasing entertainment fans for many more decades to come.”

Isn’t that what Blockbuster said before Netflix acquired them? Just saying.

What was the best DVD you rented from Netflix, and why?
