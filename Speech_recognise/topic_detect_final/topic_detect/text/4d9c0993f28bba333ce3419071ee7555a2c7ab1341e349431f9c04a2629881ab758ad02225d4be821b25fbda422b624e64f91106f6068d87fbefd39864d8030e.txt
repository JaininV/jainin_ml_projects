Ft. Washington, MD — Trainer Steve LeBlanc doesn’t have the volume that some barns do, however, what he does have is mighty good.

Tuesday night (April 11) at Rosecroft, Somegirlsomewherea and Need Ur Opinion won the first and the last race on the card, giving Leblanc, 11 wins in 21 starts at the meet and a UTR of .635.

In the $12,000 Mares Open Handicap Pace, Johnathan Ahle sent Somegirlsomewherea to the front and she made it three in a row, winning in a lifetime best 1:51.1. Since arriving in February for LeBlanc and owner Robert Cacamese, the 7-year-old daughter of Somebeachsomewhere has won four times in eight starts and only missed the board once.

Need Ur Opinion won the finale for driver Roger Plante, one of three wins on the night for Plante, and second for Cacamese as an owner. It was the third win in the last five starts for the 6-year-old daughter of Warrawee Needy.

Northern Express was happy not to see the likes of Ya’ll Beneath Me or Muscle Dynasty on the gate, and was able to hold off the classy Judge Bob in a two horse sprint to the wire in 1:54.3 in the Open Handicap Trot. The 7-year-old son of Muscle Massive has been on the board in all 13 starts this year, collecting $81,290 in the process. He’s been in the top three in 73 of 113 starts and earned $507,691. Russell Foster guided the winner for owner-trainer Arty Foster Jr.

Foster won twice on the card as did Ahle, John Wagner, Frank Milby, and Johnathan Roberts.
