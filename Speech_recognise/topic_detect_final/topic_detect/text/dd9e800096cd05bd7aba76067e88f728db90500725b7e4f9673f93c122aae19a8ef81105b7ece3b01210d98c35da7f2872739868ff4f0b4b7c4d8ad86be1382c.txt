Horizon: Forbidden West has a massive open-world for you to explore, and within this open-world, many activities for you to do in your adventure as Aloy. From climbing tallnecks to completing cauldrons, there are a variety of different things you can do in the massive open-world that is the Forbidden West. The original Horizon game also had a massive open-world, but its DLC, Frozen Wilds, added another entire area to the open-world, making it even larger. The DLC for Horizon: Forbidden West is also adding a new area, that being the Burning Shores of Los Angeles. This is again making the already massive open-world even larger, but there are a few catches to getting to this new area. Here’s our guide on how to access the Burning Shores DLC in Horizon: Forbidden West.

There are a couple steps you need to take before you go to the Burning Shores. The most important step of these is to complete the main story of the game. The Burning Shores DLC in Horizon: Forbidden West is a post-game story, which means it takes place after the completion of the main story as a sort of epilogue to the game. So once you complete the main quest with the name ‘Singularity’, you’ll be able to take part in the Burning Shores DLC.

Once you’ve finished the main story of Horizon: Forbidden West, you should spawn back at The  Base. When you’re there, you should receive a call from Sylens, talking about how he needs to see you to discuss something with you. This is how you activate the Burning Shores quest, and start the DLC in Horizon: Forbidden West.

After that, you’re going to need to go to Tilda’s house from the main story of the game in the bottom left of the map and talk to Sylens. There will then be a dialogue choice to take you to the Burning Shores of Los Angeles.

Horizon: Forbidden West is available to purchase from the PlayStation Store.
