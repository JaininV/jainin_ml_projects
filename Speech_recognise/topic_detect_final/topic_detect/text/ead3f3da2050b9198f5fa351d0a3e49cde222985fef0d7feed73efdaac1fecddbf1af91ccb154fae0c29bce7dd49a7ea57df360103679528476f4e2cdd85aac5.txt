Independent Senator David Pocock says he is “very disappointed” with the government allocating room in the budget for anything but JobSeeker and calls for them to show an “investment in Australia’s future”.

“I’m very disappointed with the response,” Mr Pocock told Sky News Australia.

“The committee said we recognise that the budget is tight so there could be a staged approach to ensuring the JobSeeker payments are going up over time.

“This is an investment in Australia’s future, in our families in our communities … and the kind of society we want to be going forward.”
