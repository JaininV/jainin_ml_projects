The Dare County Tax Department has announced that a project designed to capture street-level imagery of commercial and residential properties throughout Dare County has begun.

The project is being performed by a company called Cyclomedia, which is based in Madison, Wisconsin, and specializes in capturing and recording visual data in public spaces using a patented camera system that is mounted on vehicles.

Cyclomedia’s vehicles will traverse Dare County roadways for a period of approximately four to six weeks. During this time, they will capture light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data to create 360-degree panoramic images of properties that will replace the front-facing photos currently posted on the Dare County GIS. These photos will ultimately be used for appraisal reviews and other tax-related purposes once the project is complete.

The Dare County Tax Department assures residents, visitors and property owners that any faces or license plates that may be captured by Cyclomedia’s cameras will be blurred to protect individuals’ privacy.
