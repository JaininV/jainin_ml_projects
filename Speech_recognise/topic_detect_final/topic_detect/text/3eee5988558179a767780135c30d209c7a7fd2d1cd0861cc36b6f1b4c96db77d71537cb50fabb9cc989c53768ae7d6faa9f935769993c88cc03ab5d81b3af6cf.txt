Mixing and matching amongst the Allied Forces, the Indi + Ash Reversible Rana Jacket in Indigo takes some familiar military themes, adds them all up and vat dye them a few times. Taking its shape from the USMC’s p42 Jacket, this reversible jacket has two camos at play with instead of 2 variations of the same one.

On one side you have the familial cloud-looking camo which presents really well as an alternative universe frogskin design. However, flip things over and you get this paintbrush camo popular on windproof smocks made for the British Army.

This jacket is made from hand-woven organic cotton, features corozo nut buttons reminiscent of Vietnam-era fatigues, and is twice-washed for a vintage, worn-in effect. It’s a whimsical piece that collides military garb with the indigo renaissance we find ourselves enjoying in the modern day, and we can’t think of a wardrobe this wouldn’t improve. Just be careful on the first few wears because this sucker will bleed a little. But hey, you have to crock some fabric to develop fades, right?

Available for $348 from Franklin & Poe.
