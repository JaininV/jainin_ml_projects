A lot of smaller items to catch up on this week...

* Houston #1 for single-family home building permits, and a close #2 for total permits behind DFW. Austin gets the hype but Houston and DFW have the numbers. Hat tip to Oscar. Click/tap on graph for a larger version.

* Houston Alliance for Reasonable Traffic Solutions (ARTS). Fantastic site exposing how road diets are hugely problematic. Hat tip to Barry.

* The best argument I've seen for school choice: in states that have implemented it, public schools for low-income students have gotten dramatically better even while not losing many students!

* Fortune: The $300,000 starter home is going extinct (archive link): ‘A renter society not because of choice but because of force’ Affordability has collapsed across the country, although Houston and San Antonio continue to outperform. The Dallas collapse is surprising - almost as bad as Austin. Percentage of new homes under construction which are priced under $300,000, according to Zonda Home: (click/tap on graph for a larger version)

* Transit Agencies Go Insane. These numbers are absolutely bonkers and yet are getting no media coverage whatsoever:

"In the 1990s, light-rail lines that cost $50 million a mile ($100 million in today’s dollars) were considered extravagantly expensive. A decade ago, the average light-rail line cost about $125 million a mile ($160 million in today’s dollars). Last year, average light-rail construction costs had risen to $278 million a mile (about $310 million today).This year, the average light-rail cost has grown to $384 million a mile. Average commuter-rail costs have grown from $232 million a mile last year to $447 million a mile. Average heavy-rail costs have exploded from $974 million a mile to $1.4 billion a mile."

"On November 2020, in the midst of the pandemic, Austin voters foolishly agreed to raise property taxes in order to build 28 miles of light rail at a projected cost of $5.8 billion. To avoid congestion, the downtown portion of light-rail lines would go through a four-mile-long tunnel. No one reading this blog will be surprised to know that, in the short amount of time since then, projected costs have nearly doubled to $10.3 billion. Early this week, the city’s transit planners announced a new plan that would build fewer than half as many miles of light rail."
