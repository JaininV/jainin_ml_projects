A mum named Geraldine Gimblet who spent all her life savings on her daughter’s cancer treatment has won a whopping lottery jackpot worth $2 million on a scratch-off ticket in the Florida lottery.

Geraldine who lives in Lakeland bought the lottery ticket which was the last available ticket at that time, from a gas station near Tampa just a day after her daughter’s last round of cancer treatment was completed.

The New York Post wrote, “Gimblet, who is from Lakeland, had stopped at a gas station hoping to purchase one of the crossword “$2,000,000 BONUS CASHWORD Scratch-Off game” lotery tickets, but the clerk said they were all out.

“Instead of taking her losses, Gimblet asked for the worker to check again.”

She only used her $10 to purchase the scratch-off ticket.

“At first, the gas station clerk thought there were no tickets left, but I asked him to double check because I like the crossword games the best,” she shared. “He found the last one!”

When Geraldine won the cash prize, she was invited to come at the Florida Lottery Headquarters in Tallahassee with her daughter and granddaughter to receive her prize money.

As per the Lottery’s website, “After winning the game’s top prize, Gimblet chose to take a one-time, lump-sum payment of $1,645,000, which had a 1-in-3.9 million chance of cashing.”

After winning the prize money the family did not seem so happy as they had to go through a difficult time at that time because of Geraldine’s daughter’s breast cancer treatment. However, the lucky girl’s treatment completed successfully.

“The day before my mom bought this ticket, I rang the bell and walked out of the hospital after completing my last treatment for breast cancer,” her daughter said to the lottery.

“My mom had taken out her life savings to take care of me when I was sick. I’m just so happy for her!”
