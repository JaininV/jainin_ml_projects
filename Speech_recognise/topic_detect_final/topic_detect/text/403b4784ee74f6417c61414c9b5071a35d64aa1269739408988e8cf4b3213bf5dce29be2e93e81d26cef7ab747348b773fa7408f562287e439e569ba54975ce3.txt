A SAVVY DIY fan has revealed how she transformed her bedroom on the cheap.

Nat shared the transformation on TikTok and people couldn't believe the results.

Posting the transformation to her TikTok account @natsslife101, Nat said: "I cannot believe that I'm actually on here to all you thousands of people posting up the actual state of my bedroom."

In the clip, Nat's pink and silver wallpaper was hanging off the wall and in serious need of some TLC.

Instead of buying a wallpaper steamer, Nat used her initiative and used her clothes steamer to strip the wallpaper off the wall.

She said: "But, yeah, my room's been a state, and, I mean, it's been a state for such a long time.

"Obviously, it look worse because I started to pull the paper before I took the picture."

"It is the definition of a bed in a room," she added.

Nat decided to take the smaller room in her home after her younger brother moved in and had failed to find the time to make it hers.

But she decided the day had come as she filled in any cracks and holes in her walls so they would be ready for a fresh coat of paint.

The bargain-lover managed to save money by using leftover paint she had lying around after transforming her kitchen.

Once the paint had dried, she added some new floor-length curtains for £23 from M&S and the room was almost finalised.

She also bagged the wall filler, paint brush and roller for just £15.

She added that she needed to buy some new furniture but was much happier with the room already.

"62 quid & 3 days work all in 1 minute, 10x better the blank spot I needed. Now I need a bed and storage because I went mad a really threw out most my stuff NO REGRETS..." she captioned the post.

The video has since gone viral with over 420k views and over 20,000 likes.

People quickly took to the comments section praising Nat for her DIY skills.

Someone else wrote: "Looks absolutely beautiful, well done."

"Right you gave me the inspiration to do mine wish me luck," claimed a sixth.
