The Kingston Frontenacs would like to send well wishes to the 7 members of their alumni that begin their quest to win the Stanley Cup in the 2023 NHL Playoffs.

Participating in the playoffs are Sam Bennett (FLA), Gabriel Vilardi (LA), Jason Robertson (DAL), Phillip Grubauer (SEA), Warren Foegele (EDM), along with former coaches Bruce Cassidy (VGK) and Paul McFarland (SEA).

Best of luck to those seven Frontenacs Alumni and we hope we can soon call one of these seven players a Stanley Cup Champion.
