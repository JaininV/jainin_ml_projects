Lifestyle and gaming peripheral brand Higround is no stranger to collaborations, having joined forces with Jujustsu Kaisen, Attack on Titan, and Sega previously. For its latest project, the team is venturing back into the video game space yet again, as it pays tribute to Ryu and friends with a Street Fighter keyboard and gaming equipment collection.

Available for pre-order on from 19 to 24 April, the Capcom offering will mark Higround’s first foray into the global market, with availability slated for Europe, Japan, and the U. S. The collection features four keyboards — two Basecamp 65 models and two iterations of the Summit 65 flagship build — that come decked out in Street Fighter II character art, including an exclusive design for fan favourite character Akuma. Do note, however, that the red-framed Akuma Summit 65, is only exclusive to Japan.

Both the Basecamp and Summit 65 are 65% keyboards, making them smaller than a full-size or tenkeyless (TKL) build. Essentially, they have all the main keys, alongside dedicated arrow keys and an extra row of keys along the right-hand side, which would be missing on the 60% layout.

The remaining line-up, meanwhile, comprises three mousepads, keyboard-matching keycap sets, a bag featuring Ryu and Chun-li, and a t-shirt. No word on pricing just yet, but more details will be released on the website once pre-order goes live at 12pm ET on 19 April.
