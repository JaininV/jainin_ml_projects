CLEVELAND, OH--- Unlike Saturday night in game 1, the Cavs were physical and dominate over the New York Knicks in a 107-90 victory Tuesday night in game 2.

Coming off of a 101-97 loss in game 1, the Cavs told a much different story Tuesday night in game 2, taking the physicality to New York. The first quarter looked like it would be much of the same as Saturday night, but after the first quarter ended, the Cavs started the turn the tide, the Cavs showed off their league leading defense tonight, as the Cavs would end the first quarter with a steal by Cedi Osman, allowing Caris LeVert to hit his 2nd 3 ball of the game at that point, capping off the first quarter leading the Knicks 25-22. Along with being physical on defense, the Cavs were also physical in the paint offensively, attacking the rim leading to 17 free throws made. The defense was the key for the Cavs all game, forcing 14 first half turnovers, getting as many as 27 points off of said turnovers during the game. All around, the Cavs were playing amazing team basketball tonight, the ball was moving very well for Cleveland, racking up 14 first half assists. Bringing me to Darius Garland, who closed out the first half with 26 points, joining LeBron James and Kyrie Irving as the only 3 Cavs with a 25+ point half in the last 25 years for the Cavs. Garland would finish with 32 points and 7 assists.

Another thing the Cavs did well that they didn't in game 1 was crash the boards, winning the rebound battle 54-44. The duo of Evan Mobley and Jarrett Allen did an amazing job crashing the boards, with Mobley securing a double double with 13 points and 13 rebounds, his fellow big man Jarrett Allen would pull in 10. Another double-double performance came from Donovan Mitchell, who would set his playoff career high in assists in 13 along with 17 points. Last but not least was a first half star, Caris LeVert who nailed 3 pointer after 3 pointer, making 4 of his 9 attempts finishing with 24 points.

The Cavs are going to carry this momentum to Madison Square Garden Friday night for game 3. Tip-off is set for 8:30 and you can hear it on WTAM 1100 am, 106.9 FM, the free iHeartRadio app, and HERE
