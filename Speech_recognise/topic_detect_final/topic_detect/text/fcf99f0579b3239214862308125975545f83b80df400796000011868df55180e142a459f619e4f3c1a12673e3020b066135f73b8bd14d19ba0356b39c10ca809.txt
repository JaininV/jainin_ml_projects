Holocaust Remembrance Day begins at sundown and runs all day Tuesday.

Blanche Feinberg is one of many Holocaust survivors who attended an event at a Boca Raton synagogue on Sunday.

She tells CBS 12 News that when she was eight, her mother gave here away to a priest in Belgium and then survived by living in orphanages and farms.

"I spoke in schools for hundreds and thousands of children.  I told them my story and they were all so receptive to what I had to say."

Feinberg says the recent acts of antisemitism scare her.

A bill aimed at tackling some of that will be heard by the full House on Thursday.  It would make it illegal to project anything onto a building you don't own, after someone projected a swastika on a building in West Palm Beach.

The bill, sponsored by Palm Beach County Republican State Rep. Mike Caruso, would make it a felony if whatever is projected amounts to religious or ethnic animus.

A Senate version is in its final committee.
