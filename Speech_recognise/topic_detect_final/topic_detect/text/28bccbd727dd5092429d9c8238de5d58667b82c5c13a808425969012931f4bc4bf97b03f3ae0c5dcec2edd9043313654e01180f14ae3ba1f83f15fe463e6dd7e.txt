The eight villagers who were abducted by gunmen in Owukpa, Ogbadibo Local Government Area of Benue State on Sunday, have all been released by their abductors.

DAILY POST had earlier reported that the daredevil gunmen causing mayhem in the community ambushed the villagers along the Atamka-Ugbugbu road while they were returning from the Aho-Ogbo local market Sunday evening.

The criminal elements had demanded N500,000 ransom from each victim. One of the abductees, John Ameh was freed on Tuesday due to his health challenges.

One of the victimsâ€™ father, Agada Ikwuta, however, told our correspondent on Wednesday that all the abductees have been released after N400,000 ransom was paid.

According to him, the victims have since reunited with their families.
