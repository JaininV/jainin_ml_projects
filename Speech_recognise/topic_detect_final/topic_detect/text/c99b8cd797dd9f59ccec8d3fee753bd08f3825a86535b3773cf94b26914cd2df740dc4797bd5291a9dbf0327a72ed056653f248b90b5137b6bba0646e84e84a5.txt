Latest Addition To The Spill’s Library Illustrated By Steinberg

I routinely roam the internet with The New Yorker and its artists in mind, hoping to come across something new or old  I’ve never seen before. The other day I came across this 1947 title, How To Disappear For An Hour, a collection of pieces by The New Yorker writer, Geoffrey Hellman. It was the cover drawing by Steinberg that caused me to pause.

It’s always a conundrum (for me) whether to purchase a book simply for the cover art, but through reading booksellers’ descriptions of the content I learned there were a number of Steinberg illustrations in the Hellman book.

A bonus reason for purchase: the Spill library did not have a Geoffrey Hellman collection. As Hellman was one of the most prolific New Yorker contributors, this was an oversight that needed correcting.

Haven’t yet read through — the book just arrived — but have enjoyed the art on the cover, as well as the many illustrations inside (there are approximately 40):

Here’s the cover art and one of the illustrations:

I cannot talk of Steinberg this week without thinking of Edward Koren, who passed away last week. In my interview last year with Ed, he said of Steinberg: [he was] “the master — the master of masters in our profession, in our craft, in our thinking.”
