Melissa Leong has lashed out at an online troll who brutally questioned her qualifications as a television food judge as she wasn't a 'world-renowned food critic'.

The Facebook user cruelly said producers 'scraped the bottom of the barrel' when they hired her as a MasterChef judge since she didn't own a restaurant at the time.

Not to be cowed by harsh words, the food writer, 41, took to Instagram on Friday to slam the naysayer with a list of her credentials before boasting about her house.

'Haven't owned restaurants, just written for half a dozen of Australia's highest profile publications for over a decade,' Melissa began her rant.

'It's ok though, us non-white males are used to [being] overlooked. It's how you don't see us coming till we've arrived.'

Melissa went on to share a list of popular cookbooks she has ghost written and edited before bragging about working with 'industry legends' such as Marco Pierre White, Gelato Messina, Zumbo, and MLA.

'If that's scraping the bottom of the barrel, Gerrard, it must be very hard to see me from your lofty seat in the clouds doing…what is it you do exactly?' she added.

'Thank you, armchair prince. I'm sorry you've had such a bad day you feel the need to s**t on a stranger who has bled for her career.'

Melissa finished off the tirade by revealing she also co-hosted and judged an old cooking show called The Chef's Line, before boasting about buying her own home with all the money she's made from her successful career.

'FYI, I am writing this while sitting in my house, that I bought all by myself, with my unqualified, ill-gotten gains. Cheers,' she wrote.

She has accomplished a long and successful career in the cooking industry as an Australian television host, freelance food writer, radio broadcaster, critic, cookbook editor and marketer.
