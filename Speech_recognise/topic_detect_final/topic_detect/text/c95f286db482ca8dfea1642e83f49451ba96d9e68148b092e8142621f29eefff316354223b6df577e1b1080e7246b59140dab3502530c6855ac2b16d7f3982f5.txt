KUALA LUMPUR, April 12 — Following his successful comeback concert in Las Vegas, Taiwanese Mandopop star Wang Leehom will be coming to this side of the world to perform for his fans.

The 46-year-old is scheduled to sing at the Bangkok International Trade and Exhibition Centre on June 10.

Taking to his social media, Wang announced that the tickets will be available for sale from today at 8pm Malaysian time.

Wang added that he would be joined by Thai guitarist Jack Thammarat in the concert.

Tickets priced between 2,800 baht (RM361) and 7,800 baht (RM1,005) are available for purchase at http://www.oneleehom.com.

Wang returned to the stage in January after announcing he would be taking a break in 2021 following his ugly divorce from ex-wife Lee Jinglei.

In the Las Vegas concert, besides singing One which chronicles his divorce journey, Wang sang Xiang Jian Jiu Neng Xiang Jian (Meet Whenever We Want).

Written for his three children — daughters Jiali and Jiana and son Jiayao — who live with Lee, the song is about how he misses them dearly and hopes they can meet whenever they want.
