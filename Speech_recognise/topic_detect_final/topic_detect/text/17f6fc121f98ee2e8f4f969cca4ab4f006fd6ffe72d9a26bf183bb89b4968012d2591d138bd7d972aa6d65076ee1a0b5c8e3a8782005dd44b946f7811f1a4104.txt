on my last trip to paris, i had the pleasure of discovering antoinette poisson, an absolutely beautiful atelier specializing in unique homewares. our original destination was axs design in the 11th arrondissement, a lovely vintage shop that happens to share the same pretty courtyard (with a somewhat ‘secret garden’ feeling) as antoinette poisson, and the axs team took us next door to very kindly give us an introduction. antoinette poisson's signature products include leaf-printed papers, wallpapers, printed linens, perfumes, stationery, and handmade decorative objects for the home. and the atelier’s windows open onto their workshop, where you can see them block printing and hand coloring their signature wallpapers and prints in person.
