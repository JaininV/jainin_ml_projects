After nearly a decade, Anthony Doerr’s beloved World War II novel, All the Light We Cannot See, is finally getting its television debut. The show promises to closely mirror the premise set forth in Doerr’s Pulitzer Prize winner, in which a young blind French girl and her father escape German-occupied Paris for the relative safety of the port city St. Malo. With a Gestapo officer on their tail, they carry with them the precious Sea of Flames diamond and a desperate need to keep it—and themselves—hidden. But the girl soon meets another teenage boy in St. Malo, one with a dangerous Third Reich affiliation. Yet it’s his years-long connection to her that might save them both.

Set to drop on Netflix this fall, All the Light We Cannot See is a major prestige project for the streamer, which means details remain slim. After a first-look reveal on April 18, here’s what we do know so far.

* Newcomer Aria Mia Loberti as Marie-Laure LeBlanc, the blind French girl mentioned above and the protagonist of the series.

* Louis Hofmann as Werner Pfennig, the boy Marie-Laure meets in St. Malo.

The Adam Project director and Stranger Things producer Shawn Levy is directing the series, with Peaky Blinders creator Steven Knight attached as writer.

The limited drama series will be split into four parts, comprising four hour-long episodes. As of now, there seem to be no plans for follow-up seasons.

Netflix is set to release all four episodes on November 2, 2023.

Over the sounds of Debussy’s “Clair de Lune,” the All the Light We Cannot See trailer delivers snapshots of Marie-Laure and Werner across time and space, the former in Paris as a child and St. Malo as a teenager, the latter training in Nazi facilities and running through smoking rubble. The drama culminates in the title card reveal, in which the drama’s name is spelled out first in braille. Watch the full trailer below.
