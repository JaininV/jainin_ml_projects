After the game, while talking with MLB.com's Steve Gilbert, Ahmed joked that he was looking to try out for a different sport thanks to his display of hand-eye coordination.

"I've played a lot of baseball, I'm thinking about trying out for cricket next year."

When asked if he had ever hit a ball that bounced before Ahmed answered "Not even close, hopefully I'm not swinging at any balls that bounce again."

Cardinals pitcher Jordan Montgomery wasn't a fan of the outcome, "I mean, I can't throw a better curveball than that. It might have bounced in front of the plate, but that's how the whole night went."

While a unique achievement, it has been done plenty of times in MLB history. The most recognizable name on the list is Hall of Famer Vladimir Guerrero Sr., who has been able to turn a bad pitch into a base hit multiple times.

Guerrero Sr. would chime in on Ahmed pulling it off Tuesday night in St. Louis.
