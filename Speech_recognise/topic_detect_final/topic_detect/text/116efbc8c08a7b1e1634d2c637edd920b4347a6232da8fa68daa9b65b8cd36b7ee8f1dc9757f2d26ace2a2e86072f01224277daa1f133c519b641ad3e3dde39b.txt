All Blacks star Rieko Ioane has committed to the team for the next Rugby World Cup cycle.

New Zealand Rugby announced on Sunday that the 26-year-old had signed with them until 2027.

He becomes the 20th All Black signed past this year’s World Cup in France.

Crusaders guru says he's delighted to be the coach to take over from Ian Foster after the Rugby World Cup.

The 59-test international has also recommitted to the Blues and Auckland on a four-year deal.

“I’m proud to be signing through until 2027,” Ioane said.

“I’m grateful to represent the city of Auckland and right now this is the best place for me, my family and my rugby.

“I’m keen to continue building on what we have at the Blues and the All Blacks.

“I have goals I want to achieve on the domestic and international stage, so this is a commitment to completing those while cementing a legacy.”

Even though he is finishing as All Blacks coach after this year’s World Cup, Ian Foster said Ioane’s new contract was “great news”.

“Rieko has grown immensely as a person and a player. Having him commit to NZR and the All Blacks for the next four years is a massive boost for our team.”

Ioane has started 50 of his 59 All Blacks tests and has also made 92 appearances for the Blues.
