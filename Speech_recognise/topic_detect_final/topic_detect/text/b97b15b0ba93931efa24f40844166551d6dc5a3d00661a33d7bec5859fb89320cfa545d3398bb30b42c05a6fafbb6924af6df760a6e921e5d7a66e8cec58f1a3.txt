Historic buildings that are home to a well-known York school require repairs.

There are a series of “poor, defective elements” on the front and rear of the buildings that make up Bootham School.

Now a listed building planning application is in for restoration work, which is needed on numbers 33 and 41-59 Bootham.

There is also a proposal to create a barbecue area behind number 57.

The work would see a number of windows replaced and external walls and rainwater pipes repaired. Structural repairs are also required.

All the buildings date from the Georgian and Victorian times, and most are Grade II or Grade II* listed.

“The proposed works will be undertaken to repair current poor defective building elements on the front and rear elevations and create an outdoor sitting space surrounded with Bootham School characteristic buildings on the rear,” say planning documents.

The intention is to “contribute to long term sustainability of the buildings” by “increasing energy efficiency… whilst retaining the character of the existing property”.

Meanwhile, the “proposed sitting area creates a functional space for students to interact during break times and encourage them to spend more time in a safe and pleasant outdoor space”.
