Aishwarya Rai Bachchan is a main character on the Internet this week after Reddit chanced on a clip of the actress appearing to lose her cool at a Jaipur Pink Panthers match. Aishwarya was at the match with husband Abhishek Bachchan, who co-owns the kabaddi team, daughter Aaradhya, niece Navya Naveli Nanda and actor Sikandar Kher who is a close friend of Abhishek. The video, posted on a sub-Reddit two days ago, shows Aishwarya in an animated, in fact somewhat agitated, conversation with Abhishek after which she appears to snap at Navya Naveli or at least speak to her in an exasperated manner. Navya Naveli is then filmed rolling her eyes.

The comments section is, of course, lit. One response described the moment as "awkward." "Navya rolled her eyes, Aish looked miffed," read another. Several comments were of the opinion that Aishwarya was complaining to Navya about Abhishek. Others sounded a note of caution: "This is how every Indian family is. We just get so excited whenever a celebrity tries to act like a regular human."

This isn't the only Aishwarya Rai Bachchan video that the Internet is obsessing over at the moment. For no good reason, Reddit has also picked up an old clip of Aishwarya being affectionately told off by father-in-law Amitabh Bachchan. "He's the best," yells an excited Aishwarya after hugging Big B, to which he responds, "Stop behaving like Aaradhya."

Aishwarya Rai Bachchan has a big release this year in Ponniyin Selvan 2, the second part of Mani Ratnam's epic magnum opus on the Chola dynasty. Aishwarya plays the double roles of Nandini and Mandakini Devi opposite Chiyaan Vikram who leads a cast that includes Karthi, Trisha and Jayam Ravi.
