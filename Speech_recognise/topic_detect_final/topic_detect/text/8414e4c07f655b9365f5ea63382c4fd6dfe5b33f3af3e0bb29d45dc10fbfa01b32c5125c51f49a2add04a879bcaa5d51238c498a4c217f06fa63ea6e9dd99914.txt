State troopers identified the victim in Monday’s fiery semi-trailer crash in Brownsville as a 47-year-old Matamoros resident, who was the driver of the tractor truck which was carrying gasoline.

In a statement Tuesday evening, the Texas Department of Public Safety said Francisco Guadalupe Salinas Casas, 47, of Matamoros, Mexico died at the scene due to injuries sustained in the crash.

The crash occurred at around 7:02 p.m. on the northbound Toll Road 550 in Brownsville, where troopers said in the statement that the truck which was carrying what was previously described as “hazardous-flammable material” drove at an unsafe speed.

“The driver of the truck tractor semi-trailer lost control of the vehicle, causing it to strike a concrete barrier and roll on its side,” troopers said in the statement Tuesday. “The truck tractor semi-trailer was engulfed in flames due to the gas it was transporting.”

At one point, the Texas Department of Transportation closed State Highway 550 westbound between Baker Lane and IH-69E for hours while investigators worked the scene and crews cleared the area.

DPS said they’re continuing to investigate the crash.
