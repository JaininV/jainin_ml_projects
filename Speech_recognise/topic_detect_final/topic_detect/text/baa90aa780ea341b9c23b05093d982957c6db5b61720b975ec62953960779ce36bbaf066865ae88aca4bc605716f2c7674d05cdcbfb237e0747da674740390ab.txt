United Airlines has unveiled a huge expansion into Oceania and the south Pacific region, representing the largest such growth drive by a US airline.

Part of the expansion will feature the first non-stop flight between San Francisco and Christchurch in New Zealand; while United will also offer direct links between Los Angeles and Brisbane in Australia and Auckland in New Zealand; as well as twice daily flights between San Francisco and Sydney, a daily flight to Brisbane and increased capacity on its San Francisco-Melbourne route.

United also has a partnership with both Air New Zealand and Virgin Australia, allowing passengers the option of one-stop connections to more than 50 destinations in the south Pacific region. United already flies to more Australian and New Zealand destinations than all of the other US carriers combined.
