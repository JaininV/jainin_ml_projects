Experts have warned of a looming recession for months as the Fed jacked up interest rates by 475 basis points over the past 13 months to get a grip on surging price pressures. Investors expect the US monetary authority to raise rates one more time in May, lifting them by another 25 basis points to a target range of 5%-5.25%, according to the CME FedWatch tool.
