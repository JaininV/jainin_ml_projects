New Delhi, April 18: Indian students are reported to have been restricted from around five Australian universities over fraudulent visa application cases. According to reports emerging from sections of Australian media, it has been alleged that migrants from India used the student visa system as an easier alternative to access work rights in Australia.

Reports further said that cases of sham visas are on the rise and therefore, Australian authorities have restricted entry of Indian students. Delhi Police Busts ‘Fake Visa Racket’, Over Rs 2.5 Lakh Cash Recovered; Four, Including One Woman, Arrested.

With Australia expecting a huge surge of Indian students this year, the reports said that cases of expected visa fraud have raised concerns within authorities.
