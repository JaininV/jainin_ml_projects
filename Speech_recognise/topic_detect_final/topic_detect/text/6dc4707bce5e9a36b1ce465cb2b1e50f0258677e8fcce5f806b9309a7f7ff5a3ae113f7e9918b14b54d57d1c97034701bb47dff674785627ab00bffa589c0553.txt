(ANSA) - ROME, APR 18 - Several hundred people gathered for a peaceful demonstration near Rome's central Piazza Venezia on Tuesday to protest against new restrictive migrant policies contained in a government decree and subsequent amendments currently before parliament for conversion into law.

The organizers of Tavolo Asilo e Immigrazione (Asylum and Immigration Table), a grouping of organizations promoting the rights of migrants, refugees and asylum seekers in Italy, denounced the government's "lies" on migration, adding that "the construction of political barriers on the issue of immigration is intolerable".  "No to the lies of a racist state," they said.

Opposition leaders, trades union leaders, civil society representatives and members of the general public attended the sit-in called in protest at the so-called Cutro Decree, approved by the government of Giorgia Meloni in the wake of the February 26 migrant boat shipwreck that left 94 people confirmed dead, and subsequent proposed modifications that opponents say will weaken Italy's protection regime and make the integration and inclusion of refugees and asylum seekers more difficult.
