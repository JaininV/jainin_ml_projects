There was a ghost on the streets of Detroit in the 1970s. Appearing out of nowhere, dominating the street racing scene, and disappearing just as quickly, this 1970 Dodge Challenger HEMI R/T earned the nickname 'The Black Ghost'. The identity of the driver was a mystery for decades until 2017 when the car made an appearance years after its last sighting. Ordered new by army veteran and Detroit police officer Godfrey Qualls, this Challenger is one of only 23 Hemi Challenger R/T SEs made in 1970 with a four-speed manual transmission, and one of only four Hemi R/T SEs with the Gator Grain top. Godfrey gifted the car to his son before he passed away in 2015, and the car remains in drivable but unrestored condition. This legendary piece of American history will go to auction at Mecum's Indianapolis event in May 2024.
