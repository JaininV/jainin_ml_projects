We’ve had some new babies!

Fruit for Cheese is rich and fruity, it’s the perfect way to turn your simple cheeseboard into a sumptuous feast. We are delighted that our new range is now available in fig, damson and classic quince and in two size options, including a mini kilner. Ideal for food gifting, even if it is a gift for yourself.

Another new product this month is Creamed Horseradish which is piquant, creamy and packing a real punch. Also new in April is Piccalilli, it’s crunchy, punchy and munchy. We hope you love it as much as we do.
