A producer for the popular online game, World of Warcraft, recently took to Twitter to express their frustration with Blizzard Entertainment. The producer, Adam “Glaxigrav,” claimed that the studio is facing a loss of capacity, which is causing them to create “crisis maps” of achievable projects. Blizzard has been embroiled in a series of controversies and scandals in recent years, leading to layoffs and employee departures. Glaxigrav specifically called out Blizzard’s higher-ups for not listening to the game directors who make their products. They went on to state that they simply want to make better video games and experiences for players. Unfortunately, with the loss of talent, Glaxigrav noted that the company can’t achieve this goal. They revealed that they have a schedule of people leaving the company and that there are crisis maps of what the team can or cannot ship. Fans and followers expressed their support for Glaxigrav, but uncertainty lingers regarding Blizzard’s future plans for content given the ongoing departures of talented staff.
