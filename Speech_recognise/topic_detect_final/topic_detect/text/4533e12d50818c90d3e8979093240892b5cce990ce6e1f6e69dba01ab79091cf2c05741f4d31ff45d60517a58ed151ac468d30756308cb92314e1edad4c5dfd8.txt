Spring will be in full swing for the Batavia Plain Dirt Gardener Plant Sale on Saturday, May 13.

The sale will be 9 a.m. to noon in the Bethany Lutheran Church gym, 8 S. Lincoln St. in Batavia.

Plants are sourced locally from the gardens of club members. You'll find many sun and shade native plants, perennials, iris, hosta, ferns, shrubs, small trees, grasses, sedges, bulbs, groundcovers, and often annuals and house plants to choose from.

Do you want native flowing sun loving plants or something that grows tall or stays small? They will have them. Come see what selections this year will bring.
