LEGENDARY Australian comedian Barry Humphries has been rushed to hospital just days after being discharged.

The 89-year-old, who is most famous for his character Dame Edna Everage, has been readmitted to hospital in Sydney after suffering a "serious" health setback.

His family have rushed to be by his side at St Vincent's Hospital in the east of the Australian city.

The famous entertainer recently suffered a hip replacement but has experienced complications, according to Australian entertainment journalist Peter Ford.

He said: "Statement to media due to be released shortly. At this moment Barry is in a serious condition but is being kept comfortable. He's surrounded by family."

Earlier on Wednesday, Ford admitted "things are tough" as he asked Australians to send the veteran entertainer their love.

He added: "I reckon Barry has a fighting spirit and he's not going to give up easily."

It comes just weeks after Humphries revealed he was in "agony" following a fall at his home in February that left him needing a hip replacement.
