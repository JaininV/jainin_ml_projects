In Yaroslavl, motorists complain about the condition of one of the busiest city highways – Oktyabrya Avenue. On the stretch between the YaMZ overpass and Karda Marksa Square, road workers removed long, long strips of damaged asphalt with a cutter. But the resulting recesses were not closed by new “patches”. The strips of the cutter are laid askew, it is almost impossible to choose a travel route to move in the current, while not getting into pits and potholes with the wheels of the car.

“When I was driving there, I cried,” residents of Yaroslavl are genuinely sad on social networks. Residents complain of damaged car suspensions, lost nerves and wasted time “sneaking” into the pits.

“The last four years are getting worse and worse… It becomes a pity to be a Yaroslavl when you come even to ordinary small provinces, it is clear that Yaroslavl has slipped to the level of an abandoned village,” citizens report .

Meanwhile, the mayor’s office is in no rush to announce when this patch repair will be paved.
