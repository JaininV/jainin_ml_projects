As soon as I fell into the 3D world, I became obsessed with it. Characters were the thing I loved the most, as I loved the challenge of bringing “life” into sculpture. I started exploring more traditional art as well as digital and I began to gravitate towards amazing artists such as Arsen Asyrankulov, Toto Dost, Rodion Vlasov, Allen Williams, Zdzisław Beksiński, Steven Zapata, Roberto Ferri, Rodin, Grzegorz Gwiazda, Shane Wolf, Ran Manolov, Gio Nakpil and many many more.

I have always liked horror and dark art, so it was natural for me to progress in that kind of style and explore it through digital sculpture. I wanted to reach a level where the sculpture would feel natural and almost alive and bring a "soul" into the characters. I find it the most interesting and frustrating part of the process, and I am still learning a lot. As you will see, most of my references are actually from drawings and sculptures, as I got quite interested in bridging the gap between traditional and digital.

The most important part of my journey was realizing the importance of learning anatomy. I remember that I avoided learning anatomy for the first year, as I was fooling myself with a belief that the knowledge of it is not necessary as long as I can learn visually from the reference. That was, of course, wrong, as a lot of the time if one doesn't know what forms they are sculpting, the sculpture just looks wrong on so many levels. I started learning from the book Anatomy for Artists by Eliot Goldfinger and going to a nearby Academy of Arts for extra drawing classes with a life model. What I can recommend is to sculpt without symmetry, directly in a pose, as that allows someone to push their sculpting limits more. Also, it takes twice as much time and is twice as much fun; I still consider myself at an intermediate stage, and I have so much more to learn. I am still studying anatomy actively and will probably continue to do so for a long time.
