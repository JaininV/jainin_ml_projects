Russian leader Vladimir Putin gave America the middle finger when he met with Chinese Defense Minister Li Shangfu at the Kremlin, Business Insider reports.

“The decision to accept Li was a sort of show of the middle finger by the United States, which in 2018 imposed sanctions on a Chinese official,” the document said.

The article also indicates that this decision was a serious challenge for the United States.

It is specified that such a meeting could be an assessment of their geopolitical coordination in Asia and Europe, as well as areas of military cooperation in the future.
