Bail reform was back up for discussion during the Federation of Northern Ontario Municipalities’ April meeting.

FONOM and local police services met again to discuss bail reform and the impacts of property damage on Northern Communities while in Timmins for their monthly meeting.

“We have businesses and homes that are repeatedly targeted,” said Chief of the Timmins Police Service Daniel Foy.

“It can lead to defeatism and cause one to lose faith in the justice system,” he stated.

The four main points of the resolution include creating a designation of a chronic persistent offender, allow community impact statements at bail and at bail hearings, create reverse onus in bail for all firearms offences and all bail-related gun charges go to the superior court for bail release.
