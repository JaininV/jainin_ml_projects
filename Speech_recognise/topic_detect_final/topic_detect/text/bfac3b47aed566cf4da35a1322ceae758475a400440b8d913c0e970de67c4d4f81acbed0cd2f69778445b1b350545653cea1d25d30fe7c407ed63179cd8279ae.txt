I'd love to have a daily routine, but it's so hard when everyday is so different...truthfully everything is a little bit of a whirlwind at the moment ahead of opening our new store on Pimlico Road.

On top of the store, I'm working on a beautiful private residence in Jordan and a few other projects in the US. I’ll also be launching my first ever online course with Create Academy - ‘The Definitive Guide to Decorating’ - next month. It never stops - the pace only ever seems to accelerate, but I honestly feel so lucky to spend everyday doing something I love so much.
