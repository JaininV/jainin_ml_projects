What did you like about the book? Nila loved to go to the thrift store with her mom. One day she finds a coat there that she loves, and wants to buy it with her birthday money. But her mom says that Nila doesn’t need another coat, and to take it up with her father on the weekend. Her dad is fine with Nila buying the coat. When she learns that her classmate Lily and her family are “going through a hard time,” Nila remembers how Lily hasn’t worn a coat recently at school. Kids can’t go out for recess unless they bring a coat to wear, so Lily has had to stay inside. Nila’s mom clears it with Lily’s mom, and Nila gives Lily her newly purchased coat. The last spread shows two happy girls swinging on the swings at recess.

It’s interesting to see Nila make her decision about giving away the coat she had wanted so badly. I liked that her parents made it easy for her to do, despite being divorced. But it is a tricky thing to figure out how to help those who are struggling without causing embarrassment, and the book succeeds in making it work. It like that there are two pages of resources on how to facilitate coat donations in one’s community. The matter of fact tone communicates that caring for one’s classmates is a good thing. Charming illustrations from the illustrator of Lesléa Newman’s Sparkle Boy.
