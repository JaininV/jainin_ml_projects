Or he may not.

Sosa’s notorious BM Slim Danger has it out for Keef.  While riding in a car with her new man Shams Sudden, they both threatened Sosa.

“Man, I’ll slap the f*ck out of you f*cking Chief Keef, n*gga,” Shams said.

“Me and the whole state of California are looking for Chief Keef,” Slim added.

So far no response from Sosa.
