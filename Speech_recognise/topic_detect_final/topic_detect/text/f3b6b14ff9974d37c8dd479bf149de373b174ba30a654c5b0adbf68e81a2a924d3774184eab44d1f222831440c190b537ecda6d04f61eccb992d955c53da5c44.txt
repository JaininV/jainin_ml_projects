As grass cutting season begins, local officials are reminding home owners to keep the clippings off of roadways.

Jefferson Township leaders were the latest to issue the precaution, saying that it presents a safety issue if grass starts to accumulate on the road.

The main issue is that vehicles can lose traction if they come across the grass clippings—especially if they are wet. Motorcyclists are even more susceptible to the problem, as their bikes can lose control easily over the grass clippings.
