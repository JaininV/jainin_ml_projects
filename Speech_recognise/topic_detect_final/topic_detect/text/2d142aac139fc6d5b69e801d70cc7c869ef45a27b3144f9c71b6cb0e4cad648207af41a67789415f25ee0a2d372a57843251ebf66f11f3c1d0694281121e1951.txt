Initial investigations by police suggest the driver may have lost control while travelling at high speeds, causing the vehicle to run off the road and over the cliff.

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade was providing consular assistance to the Devi family.

“Consular officials from the High Commission in Colombo are supporting another Australian woman who was injured in the accident,” a department spokesperson said.

“We send our deepest condolences to the family.”
