The U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, Memphis District recently reached a major project milestone and awarded a task order for dike construction at Below Walnut Bend and Shoofly Bar near Helena, Arkansas.

The project delivery team awarded the task order via the Mississippi River Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC), with $6,055,440 going to contractor Pine Bluff Sand and Gravel Company from Pine Bluff, Arkansas.

“This work is critical to helping maintain the navigation channel crossing in this reach of the river and we are thankful for the continued investment being made by Congress in our river infrastructure,” Memphis District Channel Improvement Project Manager Zach Cook said.

The location of the future dike work will be at or close to MS River Mile 677 and will consist of the placement of over 150,000 tons of stone on six (6) existing dikes and is anticipated to begin during the spring or early summer of 2023 and be completed within a few months depending on workable river stages.
