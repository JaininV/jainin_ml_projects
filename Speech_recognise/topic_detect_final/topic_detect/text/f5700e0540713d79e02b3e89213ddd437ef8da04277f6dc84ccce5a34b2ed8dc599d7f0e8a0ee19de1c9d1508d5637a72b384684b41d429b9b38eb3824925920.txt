A few weeks ago a  package was delivered to my address. It was wrapped in old-fashioned khaki colored paper. I did notice that there was no return address. Hummmm…. I tore off the  wrapping paper. There was a  pink paper slip that was blank . More Hummmm…I found a black and white paperback, 5″ by 7″, entitled Haun Tings. The writer was Andre Le Mont Wilson, described on the back cover as a Black, queer writer. HAUNTINGS as it’s identified on the inside cover is dedicated to MOM “who told me lynching stories”.

I have asked friends, acquaintances and everybody else if he/she sent it to me. The universal answer was NO.
