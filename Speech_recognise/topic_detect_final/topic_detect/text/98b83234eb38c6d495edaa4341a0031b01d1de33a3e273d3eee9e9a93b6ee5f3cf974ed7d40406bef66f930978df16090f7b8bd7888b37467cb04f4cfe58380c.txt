Hi, my name is Dolly

I'm a 5-year-old German Spitz from Burford rehoming centre and I'm looking for my forever home. Please read my profile below to find out more.

Help Dolly find a home by sharing this page with friends and family

Dolly is a lovely little lady who is waiting to find her perfect home. She is a very friendly little lady who loves everyone that she meets. She can however be slightly worried by excessive handling. Therefore, it is important that she really builds up a relationship with her familiar people. As Dolly is long haired, she would need regular grooming, this would need to be built up gradually and positively. Dolly can be quite vocal upon approach with other dogs. Once she has met the approaching dog and has settled, she is happy to walk alongside them. Once familiar, her vocalisations is reduced. Dolly would prefer to be the only pet in the home so that she can really build up that relationship and have all of your attention! Dolly would be able to live with older children who can read her body language and give her space. Although with Dolly's favourite spot being her favourite persons lap, she will likely be with you all the time! Time alone would need to be slowly built up to ensure that she feels comfortable in her new home. She travels well in the car and would love some outdoor adventures. Dolly is a beautiful girl who will make a brilliant companion. If you have a Dolly shaped hole on your lap please apply today.

I've been vaccinated, microchipped, wormed and neutered as required

Examined by a vet and treated if needed
