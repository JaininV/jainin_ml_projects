SALT LAKE CITY (KSL.com) — A photojournalist for ABC4 who was hit by a car in Little Cottonwood Canyon on April 6 died Monday.

ABC4 journalist Tracy Smith, 61, was working at the mouth of the canyon when he was hit by a pickup truck. He was taken to a hospital in critical condition with head trauma.

“It’s been a tough day here at ABC4 after learning about the loss of our longtime friend and co-worker,” the news station said Monday.

Since starting at ABC4 in 2011, Smith has worked as a promotions producer, a member of the digital team, and joined the newsroom as a photojournalist, the station said.

Smith worked in the news industry for nearly 40 years and had longstanding expertise and a passion for storytelling. The news station said Smith will be remembered for his storytelling both on and off the air.

“Telling stories through his lens was his greatest joy,” ABC4 said. “He enjoyed reminiscing about his military service, the great people of the state of Utah, and all his experiences through the years.”

ABC4 said Smith was an “extremely positive” influence in the newsroom and he was always uplifting and supporting his co-workers.

“He was truly one of a kind, with a sweet spirit and infectious personality. He was one of the hardest workers in the industry and truly loved what he did,” ABC4 said.

Smith is survived by his two daughters, his parents, his siblings, and his wife Shauna who also works at ABC4. This Friday would have been their 30th anniversary, the station said.
