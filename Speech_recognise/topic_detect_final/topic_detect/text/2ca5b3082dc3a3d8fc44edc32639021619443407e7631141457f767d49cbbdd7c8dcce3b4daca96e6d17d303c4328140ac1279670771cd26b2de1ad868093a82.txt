Is Your Department Prepared for Pipeline Response?

April is National Safe Digging Month, and the NVFC joins in the national effort to remind everyone to call 8-1-1 before you dig. Calling 8-1-1 prior to digging is free, it’s the law, and it ensures you don’t hit a utility line. Fire departments should also be prepared in case there is an incident involving a pipeline or hazardous material. Access a free toolkit and training for pre-incident planning, preparedness, and response at www.nvfc.org/pipelines.
