UFC Kansas City got off to a shaky start.

Bantamweights Joselyne Edwards and Lucie Pudilova went to the scorecards in Saturday’s opening bout at T-Mobile Center and Edwards eked out a split decision despite spending much of the three-round bout on her back defending against Pudilova’s grappling.

Before the verdict was read out, commentator Daniel Cormier declared the fight a victory for Pudilova. He immediately protested the judges’ decision on Twitter shortly after Edwards’ hand was raised.

“That’s really bad,” Cormier wrote. “What a bad start to the night with judging. Holy s***.”

On MMA Decisions, 14 of the 14 media members listed all scored the fight in favor of Pudilova.

That’s two straight split decision wins for Edwards, who has also missed weight for her past two fights.
