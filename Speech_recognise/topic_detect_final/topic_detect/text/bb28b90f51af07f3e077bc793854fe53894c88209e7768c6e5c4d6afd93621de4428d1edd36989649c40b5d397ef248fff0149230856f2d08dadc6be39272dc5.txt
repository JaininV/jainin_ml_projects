Some people may or may not be aware that on the 23 April 2023 the government will be testing a system they have worked on for some years which is designed to alert people through their mobile phones if there is a danger to life near to where they are. This will include for example, extreme weather conditions, fires or flooding. The texts will give advice on how to stay safe from harm.

On the 23 April 2023 all mobile phones and Tablets will make a loud siren type sound as part of the test. This will happen even if phones are set to silent or vibrate.

This system has raised some concern amongst domestic abuse charities as some domestic abuse survivors have secret or silent phones by way of a lifeline. This system from the government may increase risk to them as perpetrators could be alerted to the mobile phones in their possession.

North East Lincolnshire Council officers and local agencies want to ensure those they support, who include survivors of domestic abuse and their children, are aware of this – and of how the alerts can be switched off.

Helen Cordell is the Domestic Abuse Co-ordinator for North East Lincolnshire Council’s Safer Partnership.

“Of course, any system that alerts people to a pending crisis will be extremely welcome across the country – with increasing risks of extreme weather this is going to be more important than ever. However, there are many people for whom their ‘silent’ or ‘secret’ mobile phones are reassuring lifelines,” said Helen.

It is important to be aware that people can opt out of this alert system. For an Iphone search settings for “emergency alerts” and turn off severe and emergency alerts. Follow the same for process for androids and tablets. For older devices or Huawei turn off Extreme Threats, Severe Threats and show amber alerts.
