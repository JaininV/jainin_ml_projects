(CTN News) – The Songkran festival was estimated to have brought in 18.5 billion baht from Thai and foreign tourists by the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT).

In the neighborhood, 300,000 foreign tourists were predicted to visit Thailand over the long holiday season, making up around 60 percent of all visitors to the country over the same period in 2019.

In 2023, the TAT predicts that tourism will bring in 2.38 trillion baht. Up to 30 million foreign visitors might bring in 1.5 trillion baht, while an estimated 800 million Thais would spend over their vacation.

Meanwhile, the Economic and Business Forecast Center at the Thai Chamber of Commerce University published research on shoppers’ buying habits leading up to the 2019 Songkran festival.

Due to the unpredictability of the economy, total spending for that year was projected to be around 135 billion baht. It was predicted that this year’s Songkran festivities would generate nearly 125 billion baht in consumer expenditure.

The Songkran Festival, often known as the Thai New Year, began yesterday after being postponed for three years because of the Covid-19 outbreak. People from all around the world, as well as the locals, flocked to famous splashing places all over the country.

The Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) estimates that the total economic impact of the event, from both domestic and international visitors, might reach 18.53 billion baht over three days. The Kasikorn Research Center predicts that spending by Thai visitors could reach 23 billion baht.

Despite the searing heat and pollution, visitors to Chiang Mai, a favorite location for Songkran celebrations, packed important landmarks like Khu Muang and Tha Phae Gate. A traditional Songkran parade kicked off the celebrations in this northern region at around 2 in the afternoon.

Early this week, about a thousand Chinese visitors descended upon Chiang Mai, and the festivities promptly began. They drove across Myanmar and into Thailand via Chiang Rai, Loei, Nong Khai, and Nan.

About 50,000 people visited Bangkok’s closed-to-traffic Songkran celebration spot on Khaosan Road. President of the Khaosan Road Businesses Association, Sanga Ruengwattanakul, said that hundreds of municipal officials and police officers were deployed to safeguard the area’s safety.

The party site has strict rules against revealing attire, powdering, high-pressure water cannons, firearms, and alcohol. Water fights were allowed on the crowded Silom Road, which was not an official Songkran celebration zone but attracted Thais and tourists alike.

On Phuket, the party kicked off Wednesday night in the Patong neighborhood of the Kathu district, on Soi Bang La. Western visitors were the most numerous, and they were seen having a good time spraying each other with water pistols.

Phuket’s main ports, Ratsada and Ao Chalong, were packed with Thai and international visitors yesterday morning. Thiwat Sidokbuap, Phuket’s deputy mayor, said most visitors used the island’s speedboat service between Phuket and Krabi’s Phi Phi Island.

Similar crowds were waiting at 5 a.m. at two Surat Thani ports for ferries to the popular islands of Koh Samui and Koh Pha Ngan in the province’s south.

Hotels and resorts on the three main islands see occupancy rates of around 80% during the Songkran weekend, and all flights and trains between Bangkok and Surat Thani are completely booked during this time.

Wichawut Jinto, governor of Surat Thani province, estimates that the festival will bring in more than 1.2 billion baht in tourism revenue for the region.

Day and night, people on Rat Uthit and Sai Sanehanuson roads in the Hat Yai neighborhood of Songkhla, a major commercial center in the region’s lower half, celebrated Songkran. Tourists from neighboring countries like Malaysia and Singapore shopped at many of the city’s establishments.

Finally, visitors from Thailand, Malaysia, and Singapore congregated around the Betong border district of Yala’s landmark clock tower to participate in water fights and other traditional Songkran activities.
