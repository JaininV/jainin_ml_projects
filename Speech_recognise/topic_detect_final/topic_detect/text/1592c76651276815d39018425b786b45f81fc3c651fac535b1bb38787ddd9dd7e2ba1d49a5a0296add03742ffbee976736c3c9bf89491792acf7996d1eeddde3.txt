Every year, prom night is circled on the calendars for many high school juniors and seniors in southeast Iowa. For Mid-Prairie students, that day arrives Saturday, April 22.

The theme for the Golden Hawks this year is Tangled. Beginning at the high school, students will take part in the Grand March at 7 p.m. The dance will directly follow in the gymnasium, and continue until 11 p.m.

From there, students will head to the Wellman Parkside YMCA for their post-prom celebration titled “Game On”. With games and other activities slated for the evening, the event will end with a Price is Right-style competition, where participants can win a variety of prizes. Mid-Prairie’s post-prom concludes at 2 a.m.
