Stand your ground law does not give a the right to shoot first then ask questions later that is murder!

First, it was a sixteen year old boy was looking for his sibling, yes, wrong house, but the homeowner decided to shoot him with considering why he was there. Btw it does matter the skin color it could happen to anyone if you went to the wrong house, and the homeowner believes in standing your ground is law and not murder. Anyway, the homeowner was wrong, and my next one is the bigger murderer than this one.

Next one, it happened to a twenty year old who choose to turn around in the wrong driveway. The homeowner just shot the woman cause if the simple act of just turning around.

Both incidents are not standing your ground it is shooting first and murder instead of thinking or wondering why these people are on their property! And that is called murder so next time, people just wonder and ask questions and wait to see if these people are harmless, which they were. I hope you feel the weight and guilt of injuring the boy and killing woman for the rest of your life in prison as murderers!
