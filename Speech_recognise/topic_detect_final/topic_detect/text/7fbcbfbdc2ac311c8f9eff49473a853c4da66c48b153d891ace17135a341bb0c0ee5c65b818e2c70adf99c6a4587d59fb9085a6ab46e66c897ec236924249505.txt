Rio Ferdinand has claimed Manchester United’s season will have been better than Arsenal’s if the Gunners fail to win the league.

Speaking on the Vibe with Five podcast, Ferdinand explained: “If Arsenal don't win the league and Man Utd finish third and just the one trophy they have had a better season.

"If you're a player, forget fans, and you finish third and win a trophy, Carabao Cup whatever it is and the team above you finish second and win no trophies, who is the happier player?"

Erik ten Hag’s side appears to have been handed an injury boost after exciting winger Alejandro Garnacho posted an image of him wearing pink boots.

Garnacho had been ruled out until the final stages of the season, and it now seems he is edging closer to a return.

In the transfer market, Anthony Martial is set to STAY at Old Trafford next season after Ten Hag said that from his point of view, Martial would be at the club next season.

However, United’s pursuit of Ryan Gravenberch has taken a dent after De Telegraaf reported he became “open” to a transfer to Liverpool following talks.

It comes after a photo of the £25m-rated midfielder emerged online of him wearing Liverpool’s 2019/20 kit.

A number of other targets are now under threat too after The Telegraph reported Newcastle have pivoted away from a cautious transfer approach and will instead go all out to sign at least four “elite” stars.

The Toon have 16 players on their list, including the likes of Declan Rice, Moises Caicedo, Ivan Toney and Victor Osimhen.

Elsewhere, the Daily Mail have reported ex-United star Jesse Lingard will be offered a career lifeline by Fenerbache and clubs from the Middle East after a disappointing season with Nottingham Forest.

Meanwhile, AC Milan have emerged as a potential transfer destination for Mason Greenwood after the Italians reportedly expressed interest in his services.
