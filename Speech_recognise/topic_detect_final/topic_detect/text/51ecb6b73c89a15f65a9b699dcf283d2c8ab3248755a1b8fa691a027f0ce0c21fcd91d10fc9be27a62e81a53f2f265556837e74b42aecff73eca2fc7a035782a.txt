For many years the legacy media have identified firearms as the major social problem, one that has to be dealt with by restricting the rights of law-abiding citizens to acquire and retain guns. Whenever some criminal, terrorist, or lunatic blows people away using a gun, politicians and TV talking heads belabor the populace with diatribes about “gun violence” — as if guns made the decision to kill innocent people, rather than maniacs and thugs.

In recent days, however, the issue has moved up a notch to the next level of abstraction. Whenever somebody starts spraying bullets into a crowd, the media reports tell us that “gunfire erupted”. In other woods, there is no agency whatsoever involved in the slaughter — the gunfire just kind of happened, like thunder on a hot summer afternoon.

I’m not sure when “gunfire erupted” became the stock media phrase, but I first noticed it a few days ago. And this morning, while going through items for the news feed, I ran into it twice. First, from NBC News in Alabama:

Four people were killed and 32 injured in the gunfire that erupted at the celebration.

And then NBC News again, in Texas:

Payton Washington, 18, was shot in the leg and the back in the gunfire that erupted around 12:15 a.m. Tuesday in an H-E-B parking lot in Elgin, her father, Kelan Washington, said.

Maybe the phrase is in NBC’s current style book.

That pesky gunfire just keeps erupting! It’s like cosmic rays — it just happens. The only way to keep people safe is to take away their right to own firearms. That’ll fix it.

Now that I’m aware of the phenomenon, I’ll keep an eye out for more “gunfire erupted” news stories. If I get a large enough collection of them, I may need to do another post.
