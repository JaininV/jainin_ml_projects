The ongoing co-parenting issues between Safaree and Erica exploded on Saturday after Safaree made headlines for attending the birthday party. Safaree and Amara are filming scenes for the upcoming season of Love & Hip Hop Miami and their romance will be featured.

Erica took to social media to accuse Safaree of being unoriginal for dating women in the same industry as her, and called him out for cheating during their marriage. The former couple tied the knot in 2019 but announced their separation the following year.

On Instagram, she wrote, “Aww so cute. It’s just very interesting how my kids NEVER received gifts like this by this waste man. My daughter just turned 3. All she got was a birthday cake and a few balloons in his living room. And please don’t get me started on how he didn’t do anything for my son’s 1st birthday until two weeks after the fact.”

She continued, “And again, that was just balloons in his living room. But happy everyone enjoyed this circus theme birthday party with a deadbeat clown as the special guest. 🙌🏾”

Safaree was accused by Erica of going to Miami to film the reality series because she refused to reconcile with him. She wrote, “Before I go someone @ him – He blocked me since I won’t take his crying begging *** back (hints why he’s now desperately shooting in Miami now 😂).”

Erica criticized Safaree for failing to fulfill his financial responsibility towards their children.

“Let him know he has medical bills that’s only 8k from last year he owes along with…never mind just tell him he got it. Pay it.” Erica wrote.

Erica and Safaree share two children — Safire Majesty Samuels and Legend Brian Samuels.
