Maura Higgins has reportedly fallen out with one of her Love Island pals and it's all been happening for a while.

According to The Sun, Maura and her former co-star Lucie Donlan have ended their friendship after they went on a recent holiday together, but trouble had been there for a while before.

The publication claimed that Lucie was blindsided by the Longford native last autumn when she was randomly unfollowed on Instagram.

The story now seems to go back as far as 2021 when the two jetted off to the Maldives and have not been spotted together much since.

A source close to the gal pals told The Sun: "Lucie and Maura just drifted apart - it was fun when they were both single and going on holidays together but Lucie's settling down in Cornwall with her fiancé and Maura lives in London.

"When Maura unfollowed Lucie though, it was a bit of a shock - clearly, they weren't as close as Lucie thought they were, as it was a bit of a harsh move and ended the friendship on a bit of a sour note."

Fans are now convinced their fallout has something to do with Molly-Mae Hague's friendship with Maura as the two have gotten even closer than they already were over the last year.

Speaking to Metro in 2019 Molly-Mae said: "I do still see the people that I was close with in the villa, and Lucie and I weren’t close in the villa...we don’t speak, we weren’t close. And obviously, circumstances just mean that we’re not close like that."
