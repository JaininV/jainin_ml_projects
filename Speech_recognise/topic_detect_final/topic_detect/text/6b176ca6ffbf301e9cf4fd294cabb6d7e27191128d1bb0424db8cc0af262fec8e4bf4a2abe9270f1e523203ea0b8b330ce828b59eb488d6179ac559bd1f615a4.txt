I have opened case 06017420. At this point, I have recovered the original appliance using a snapshot backup, since that is all that was available with v3, so I can attempt the upgrade again.

I did attempt the v4 upgrade with those instructions, but the DotNet software is now too new for the v4 upgrade to run, so I'm stuck with that recovery, too! If I could recover the configuration from the v3 appliance and apply it to a new v5 appliance, that would be my preference at this point so I can have a clean installation. This original appliance was deployed as v1, and upgraded to v2, then v3, so it's had a lot of upgrades over time. I'm not sure how we missed v4 since I check for updates monthly. We had paid support available until about a month ago, but we had to let that lapse.
