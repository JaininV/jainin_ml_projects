The collapse of seven pylons on the N4 highway in Pretoria has resulted in the shutdown of a Ford plant, causing a daily output loss of 720 vehicles, reports News24. The plant lost a full day of production and will continue to be without power for the entire day on Wednesday, with no clear timeline for power restoration. There are indications that vandalism and criminal activity played a role in the collapse of the pylons, which are operated by the city but will be replaced by Eskom. The collapse of the pylons has left part of the city without power.

According to Statistics South Africa, the country's manufacturing industry experienced a decline of 5.2% year on year in February 2023. The decrease was primarily attributed to declines in the food, beverages, metals, and machinery sectors. This marks the fourth consecutive month of year-on-year decline in manufacturing activity, with only communications and professional machinery, and the automotive division showing a slight increase in activity. The ongoing challenges of rolling blackouts, infrastructure deterioration, and slow global economic growth continue to impact the manufacturing sector in South Africa.
