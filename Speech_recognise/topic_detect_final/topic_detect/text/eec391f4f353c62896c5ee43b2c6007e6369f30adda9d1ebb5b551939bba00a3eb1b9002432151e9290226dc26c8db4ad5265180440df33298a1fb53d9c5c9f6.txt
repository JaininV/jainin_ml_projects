The Chinese population was estimated at 1.4257 billion people by the middle of this year, the data said.

Meanwhile, the Worldometer website, which provides real-time international statistics on different topics, has shown that India's population stands at 1.4187 billion people as of Wednesday and China's population now amounts to 1.
