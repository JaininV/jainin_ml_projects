Omega's message got through as the Jets would defeat the Wild, 3-1 to clinch a spot in the NHL playoffs.

The game even had a wrestling flair as big hits were laid, brawls ensued, fights occurred, and the two coaches engaged in some trash talking.

Wild players better be on the lookout for a V-Trigger if these two teams meet again.
