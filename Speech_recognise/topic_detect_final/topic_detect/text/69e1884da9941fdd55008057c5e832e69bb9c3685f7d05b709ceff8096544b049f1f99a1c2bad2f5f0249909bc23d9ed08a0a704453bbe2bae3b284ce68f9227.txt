Hi everyone, hope you're doing well and staying safe. I'm running macOS Ventura on a 2023 M2 MacBook Pro. I used to run kodi on my Intel Mac with adding  and the  kodi screen reeder but as the latest version of kodi is no longer accessible on macOS. Please can anybody recommend an alternative with similar functionality? Thanks very much everyone :-)
