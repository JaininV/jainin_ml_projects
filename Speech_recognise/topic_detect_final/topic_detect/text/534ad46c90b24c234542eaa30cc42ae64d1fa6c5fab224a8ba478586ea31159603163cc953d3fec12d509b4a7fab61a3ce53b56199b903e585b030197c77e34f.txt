The former UFC lightweight champion made the decision to pull out of the fight as a precautionary measure to ensure that he could bounce back much stronger. From the looks of it, he seems to be eliminating any threat that can derail his fighting performance.

Interestingly, Beneil Daruish is still adamant about fighting under the UFC 288 card, and the UFC will shortly announce a new opponent for him.

Fans all around the world were upset when they found out Oliveira won’t be featured in UFC 288; he recently explained why he pulled out and looks forward to rescheduling the fight in the distant future.

“I wasn’t able to train, I got injured during wrestling practice,” Oliveira said as quoted by mmafighting.com. “I tried to train, I tried to do everything I could but we couldn’t, so we pulled out of the fight”.

“I have to stay [away from training] for a few days so I can go back to training soon, and then we’ll reschedule the fight, I’ll be back to training pretty soon. That’s it, I had a small injury and decided to pull out so I wouldn’t fight injured.

We’ve made that mistake once and I didn’t want to do it again. … We’re taking one step back so we can take one, two, three steps forward soon”.   Arman Tsarukyan is one of the top contenders in the lightweight division, who made an attempt to be the replacement for Oliveira and to his surprise, Beneil Darisuh accepted it.

However, the UFC didn’t entertain it at all and called off the possibility, which is a clear indication that Daruish will be fighting someone else; the only valid question to ask is, who?   Respect to @beneildariush for accepting the fight with me on May 6th. Sucks ufc didn’t want to do it. Hopefully we meet in the future âœŠðŸ¼ — Arman Tsarukyan UFC (@ArmanUfc) April 18, 2023   As far as Charles Oliveira is concerned, the fans should expect him to make a return anytime before 2023 ends; he could fight Dariush next, if not some other fighter.

If he wins his next match, a title shot cannot be denied for the former UFC lightweight champion.  (Image source: Planet Sport)
