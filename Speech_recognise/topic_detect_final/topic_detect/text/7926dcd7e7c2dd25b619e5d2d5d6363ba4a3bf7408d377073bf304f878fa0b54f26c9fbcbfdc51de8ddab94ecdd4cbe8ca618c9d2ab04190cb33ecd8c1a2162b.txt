Deadly colon cancer is on the rise among younger adults in the United States, and the numbers are scary. One in five new cases of colorectal cancer in the U. S. occurs in people under the age of 55, which is twice the rate of diagnoses for that age group just three decades ago. Since younger adults aren’t eligible for these screenings, it is easier for them to miss colon cancer at an early stage, after which it becomes far more deadly. The good news is, we can stop this alarming trend, and prevent colon cancer in younger Americans, too with the support of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force.

Please sign this petition to tell the U. S. Preventive Services Task Force: recommend screenings for folks starting at 35 years old!
