Yamaha reintroduced the Matte Black shade on the Yamaha FZ-S V3 motorcycle in India and this colour option is priced at Rs 1.21 lakh (ex-showroom). However, it is worth mentioning that this new colour option is exclusively available on the standard variant.

That being said, the Yamaha FZ-S V3 Matte Black variant remains mechanically identical to other variants of the Yamaha FZ-S V3 motorcycle. In fact, the Matte Black shade is the only change compared to other variants of the Yamaha FZ-S V3 motorcycle.

It is also worth mentioning that this powertrain has now been updated to comply with the latest RDE and BS6 Phase 2

emission norms. As such, the motorcycle also features an OBD2 port to monitor emissions in real time.

In terms of hardware, the Yamaha FZ-S V3 motorcycle comes equipped with telescopic forks at the front and mono suspension at the rear. Furthermore, braking duties are handled by a

282mm disc at the front and a

220mm disc at the rear. The motorcycle also features a

single-channel ABS.

Other than that, the Yamaha FZ-S V3 sports 17-inch alloy wheels at both ends shod by 100/80 tyres at the front and 140/60 tyres at the rear. Also, the kerb weight of the Yamaha FZ-S V3 stands at 135kg, and the fuel tank capacity is rated at 13 litres.

Matte Black shade has quite some fans, and the reintroduction of the Yamaha FZ-S V3 Matte Black shade will attract quite a

few potential customers to the showroom. As a

result, we expect to see a

slight jump in sales figures for Yamaha motorcycles in the coming months.
