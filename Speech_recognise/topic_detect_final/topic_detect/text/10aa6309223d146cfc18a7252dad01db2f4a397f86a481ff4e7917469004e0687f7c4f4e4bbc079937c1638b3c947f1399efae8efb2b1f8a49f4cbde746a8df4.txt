Anushka Sharma and Virat Kohli embody couple goals and there is no denying this. The power couple is often spotted cheering for each other on social media and otherwise. While Virat Kohli is seen cheering for Anushka Sharma on her movie premieres, Anushka is a regular fixture in most of the cricketer's matches. A case in point is Anushka Sharma's newest Instagram Stories. In it, the couple is seen chilling after Virat Kohli's IPL match on Saturday by sipping on some sparkling water. Sharing the selfie, Anushka Sharma wrote, “Post match drinks sesh-sparkling water. We party hard(ly),” and added a laughing emoji.

The party was well-deserved as Virat Kohli scored his third half-century of IPL 2023 for Royal Challengers Bangalore against Delhi Capitals in Bengaluru.
