What does AGEL stand for and what does it mean?

Acute exposure guideline levels (AEGLs) describe the human health effects from once-in-a-lifetime, or rare, exposure to airborne chemicals. Used by emergency responders when dealing with chemical spills or other catastrophic exposures, AEGLs are set through a collaborative effort of the public and private sectors worldwide.
