The NFL Draft is one of the biggest sporting events of the year. Its so big, that it beats the ratings for other sports marquee events. The first night of the NFL Draft regularly beats the NBA Playoffs, the Daytona 500, and nearly all regular season games for any sport outside of football. Not to mention last year's NFL Draft nearly beat the ratings of The Masters...and last year's NFL Draft ratings were down.

So this year, will we see any LSU Tigers get taken during the first round of the draft? Its possible...but LSU isn't the only Louisiana school who will be keeping an eye on the draft. There are a couple other schools with legitimate NFL draft prospects going into this year's draft.

Does this mean all of these players are Day-One-First-Round picks? No. But all it takes is one team to fall in love with a players skills and personality, and they can jump into a late first round pick. Something the New England Patriots and Las Vegas Raiders are notorious for.

This year, players from LSU, Tulane, Louisiana Tech, and UL-Lafayette will all have players that could hear their names called during the draft. All of these schools not only have prospects, but had players invited to the NFL Draft Combine this year. Which is a good indication that teams are considering them as draft picks.

Outside of the Louisiana schools, this sets up to be a fun draft no matter what. There's already been a trade for the #1 overall pick, and multiple teams are talking about trading up for a top 3 draft pick. So this is about to be an exciting year.
