Pet food ingredients are the various components that are used to make pet food. These ingredients can include proteins, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins, minerals, and other additives that are necessary for a complete and balanced diet for pets.

Protein sources can come from animal-based ingredients such as chicken, beef, fish, and eggs, or plant-based sources such as peas, lentils, and soybeans. Carbohydrate sources can come from grains like rice, barley, and wheat, or from alternative sources like sweet potatoes and peas. Fats can come from animal sources such as chicken fat or plant-based sources such as flaxseed oil.

A CAGR of 6.7% is Projected as the Global Pet Food Ingredients Market Expands to USD 44.5 Billion by 2027, Starting from USD 32.2 Billion in 2022.
