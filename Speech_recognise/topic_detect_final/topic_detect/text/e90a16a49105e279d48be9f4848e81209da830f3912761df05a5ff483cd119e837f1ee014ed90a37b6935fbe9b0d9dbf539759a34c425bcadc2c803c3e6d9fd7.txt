Four classic SEGA Genesis titles are now available on Nintendo Switch Online

Nintendo is regularly updating the line-up of games available for Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscribers. Just a couple of months ago, it expanded massively by introducing GameBoy Advance titles to the service.

Now, though, it has added four classic SEGA Genesis titles for players to revisit, or try for the first time.

This time around, the four SEGA Genesis titles that players get to dive into are Pulseman, Flicky, Street Fighter II: Special Champion Edition, and Kid Chameleon. Frankly, the only one I’m even remotely familiar with is Street Fighter II, and that’s because, well, it’s Street Fighter.
