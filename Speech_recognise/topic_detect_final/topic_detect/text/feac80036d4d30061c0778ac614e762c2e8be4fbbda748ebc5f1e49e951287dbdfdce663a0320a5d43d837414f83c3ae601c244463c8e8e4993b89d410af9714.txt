How my father bribed me to return to school – Davido

Award-winning musician, David Adeleke aka Davido has revealed that his billionaire father, Dr. Deji Adeleke, ‘bribed’ him to return to school.

In a recent interview, the DMW label boss said he initially quit school and left home but returned to complete his education after his father made him an irresistible offer.

Davido, who was born in Atlanta, Georgia in the US but raised in Lagos, studied business administration at Oakwood University in Alabama before dropping out.

Davido, now 30, completed a music degree at Babcock University in July 2015.

He disclosed that his father made him an offer which stated that if he (Davido) attended school from Mondays to Fridays, he (Dr. Adeleke) would build him a world-class studio and provide him with money to shoot music videos on weekends.

“My dad is just big on education. The first place I came to when I ran from home was London. From there I came back to Nigeria and my dad wanted me to go to school, so I was like ‘What is in it for me?’

“He said if I go to school, he has a land not far; he would build me a studio. But I should go to school from Mondays to Fridays and on weekends, work in the studio. It was a world-class studio. He will give me money to shoot some videos,” Davido disclosed.
