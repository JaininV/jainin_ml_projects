BOSTON – Tuesday, April 18, 2023 – Mayor Michelle Wu and the City of Boston Community Preservation Committee (CPC) today announced the approval of 56 projects totaling over $40 million through the Community Preservation Act (CPA). Following the CPC’s public hearing and Mayor Wu’s recommendation, the proposed projects were approved by the Boston City Council at their weekly meeting on Wednesday, April 12. Projects supported with Community Preservation Act funding must create or preserve affordable housing, historic sites, or open space and recreation.

“The Community Preservation Act works to build a Boston for everyone by investing in both our City’s history and its future,” said Mayor Michelle Wu. “I am proud to partner with the Community Preservation Committee on these new projects which will help preserve historic assets while boosting access to affordable housing, open space, and recreation.”

“I wish to thank the Community Preservation Committee and team for their steadfast leadership and work with the community over the past five years to enhance our neighborhoods through historic preservation, parks and open spaces, and affordable housing projects,” said City Council President Ed Flynn. “I am particularly excited to see that over $20 million of CPA funds this year will go towards funding affordable housing across the city, including $4 million to create 110 units in Chinatown to support our immigrant neighbors and working families, and $2.5 million to create affordable housing for seniors at the McDevitt Senior Homes in South Boston. Both of these neighborhoods are seeing increasing displacement of lower and middle income residents and families as a result of high rents.”

“Some of the most exciting and creative projects in our ever-changing City–innovative affordable housing projects, parks, and historic preservation projects– are the result of resident and community driven CPA proposals,” said Councilor Michael Flaherty, Chair of the Council’s Community Preservation Committee. “I am so thankful for the vision and partnership of the many leaders that helped us get the ballot measure passed years ago and continue to be thankful for the partnership with Mayor Wu and the Community Preservation Committee. I am confident that the over $40 million allocation in CPA funds will allow for significant community-driven, transformational change in every corner of our neighborhoods and look forward to another exciting round of applications.”

Including this funding round, the City of Boston has awarded over $157M to support 293 projects including 112 open space and recreation projects, 46 affordable housing projects, and 135 historic preservation projects since 2018. Mayor Wu previously announced some of these affordable housing projects as part of her investment of $67 million in new recommended funding to create and preserve more than 800 income-restricted units of housing in eight Boston neighborhoods.

The Community Preservation Fund was created following voters’ passage and adoption of the Community Preservation Act in November 2016. It is funded by a 1 percent property tax-based surcharge on residential and business property tax bills, which took effect in July 2017, and an annual state funding from the Massachusetts Community Preservation Trust Fund. The Mayor and Community Preservation Committee recommend funding use and the City Council must vote to approve.

“Under the leadership of Councilor Flaherty, the Boston CPC is thrilled the City Council approved these projects,” said Felicia Jacques, Chair of the Community Preservation Committee. “We recommended projects which respond to Mayor Wu’s commitment to advance innovative responses to historic resources, create varied housing solutions, and fund sustainable, climate conscious open spaces. In granting $40M in community resources, the largest funding since the CPA was implemented in Boston, the committee is proud to have supported these projects across the City.”
