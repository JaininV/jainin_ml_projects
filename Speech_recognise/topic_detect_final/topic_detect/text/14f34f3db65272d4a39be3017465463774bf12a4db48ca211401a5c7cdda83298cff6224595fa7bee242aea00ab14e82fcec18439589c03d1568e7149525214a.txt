Once again, nothing to really cheer about for Q3, 2023 releases for TLV, BUT the Hino Profia Tractor Head is an interesting casting, as more should be done (IMHO) to re-create commercial vehicles – these are really popular but more are made in smaller scales than 1/64.

Other than that, uninspired castings which are marginal variations of existing……..I have said it before, TLV are losing ground…………..
