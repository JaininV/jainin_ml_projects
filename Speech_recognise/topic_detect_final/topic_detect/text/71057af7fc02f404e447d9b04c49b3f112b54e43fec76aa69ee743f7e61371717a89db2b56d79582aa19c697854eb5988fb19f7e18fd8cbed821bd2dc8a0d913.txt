This week’s special offers from Disney Cruise Line include sail dates from late April into mid-September. Currently, there are 45 sail dates, available with special offers available across the majority of the fleet (expect the Wish and barely for the Magic) for sailings from Barcelona, Civitavecchia, Copenhagen, Miami, Port Canaveral, San Diego, Southampton, and Vancouver. The sail dates remain distributed across the globe, as the summer ship deployments expand embarkation port offerings. The Disney Wonder has 23 sailings, with the Disney Dream just under 20 sailings, the Disney Fantasy offering 13 sailings, and just 1 for the Disney Magic.

Looking closer at this week’s offerings, special rates for Florida Residents remains missing for the second week. As I mentioned last week, this is the first time, in a very long time there have not been any Florida Resident rates. The US Military Personnel rate increased 5 to 41 cruises. The Canadian Resident dropped 1 this week to a total of 15 sail dates.

Disney Cruise Line special offer for up to 35% off the prevailing rate for 2023 European sailings on the Disney Dream and the domestic offer for select sailings with savings up to 35% off the prevailing rate remain available for select voyages.

The special offers listed below are available to book today while inventory lasts.

Special Rates for U. S. Military Personnel (MTO) are limited to 50 staterooms per category and sailing. Pricing varies, the lowest priced category per person per night listed below. New sailings added this week are in bold. To take advantage of military cruise rates, at least one adult in each stateroom must provide Proof of Military Service. Please note: This offer cannot be combined with any other special offers or discounts. Valid for new bookings only.
