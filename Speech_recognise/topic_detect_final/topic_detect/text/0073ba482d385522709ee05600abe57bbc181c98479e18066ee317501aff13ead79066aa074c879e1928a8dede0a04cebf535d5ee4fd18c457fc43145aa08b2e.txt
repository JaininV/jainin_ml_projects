Cooking frozen Banquet turkey pot pies in an air fryer is a quick and easy way to enjoy a delicious meal. Here’s how to do it:

Remove the frozen turkey pot pies from their packaging if they are in plastic containers, and place them in the air fryer basket. If the frozen Banquet Pot pie comes in an aluminum pie plate, you can leave it in it. If your air fryer basket is small, you may need to cook the pot pies one at a time.

Use a sharp knife and add a few slices; this will help let the steam escape.

Then place the frozen pot pies in the air fryer basket, and set the cooking time for 12-15 minutes. If the crust is browning too quickly, cover it with aluminum foil to prevent burning.

Once the pot pies are fully cooked, carefully remove them from the air fryer basket using oven mitts or tongs.

Allow the pot pies to cool for a few minutes before serving.

Note: Cooking times may vary depending on the size and thickness of the pot pies, so it’s always a good idea to check them periodically while they’re cooking. Also, follow the manufacturer’s instructions for your specific air fryer model.

Here are some tips to keep in mind when cooking a frozen turkey pot pie in an air fryer:

* Preheat the air fryer: Make sure to preheat the air fryer. For 2-3 minutes before adding your frozen pot pie. This helps ensure that the pot pie cooks evenly.

* Use an oven-safe dish: If the pot pie doesn’t fit in the air fryer basket or it comes in a plastic or paper container, place it in an oven-safe dish and then place the dish in the air fryer. Make sure the dish is small enough to fit in the air fryer.

* Cover the pot pie with foil: If the crust is browning too quickly, you can cover the pot pie with foil to prevent burning. Just make sure the foil is not touching the filling, as it can stick to the pie.

* Use a food thermometer: It’s essential to check the internal temperature of the pot pie to ensure it’s fully cooked. The temperature should reach 165°F (74°C) before serving.

* Let the pot pie cool before serving: After cooking, let the pot pie cool for a few minutes before serving. This allows the filling to set and makes it easier to slice and serve.

* Follow the manufacturer’s instructions: Read the instructions for your specific air fryer model, as cooking times and temperatures may vary.

​Banquet Turkey Pot Pie Air Fryer is a hearty and easy comfort meal anytime, but if you’re looking to serve something alongside it, here are a few options:

* Side Salad: A simple green salad with a vinaigrette dressing is a great way to balance the richness of the pot pie.

* Roasted Vegetables: Roasted vegetables, such as carrots, broccoli, or Brussels sprouts, are a simple side dish to pair with the pot pie.

* Mashed Potatoes: Mashed potatoes are a classic pairing with pot pie. They’re also great for soaking up the delicious gravy from the pot pie.

* Steamed Vegetables: Another healthy option is vegetables such as green beans or asparagus. They can help lighten up the meal while still providing some nutrition.

* Cranberry Sauce: If you want a festive touch, cranberry sauce pairs well with turkey pot pie. It adds a pop of color and a touch of sweetness that complements the savory flavors of the pie.

Ultimately, the choice of side dishes will depend on personal preferences and dietary needs, but the above options can help provide some inspiration.
