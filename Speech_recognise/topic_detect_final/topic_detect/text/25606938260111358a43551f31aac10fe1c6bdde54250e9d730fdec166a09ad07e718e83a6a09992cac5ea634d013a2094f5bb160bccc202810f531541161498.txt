So when we heard that the brand was launching a pretty epic spring sale this week, we thought it was only fair that we share the details with you, along with the specific pieces our editors have bookmarked. There’s currently up to 50% off sale buys, but the brand has also shared a bonus discount code with us so that Who What Wear readers can get an extra 15% off sale items with the code CKSALE15 (you’re welcome). After scouring the entire sale edit of over 600 items, we’ve spotted so many bags and shoes that would make great investments for the current season, as well as styles that will carry you through the rest of the year ahead (and beyond). You’ve got until the 17th April to take advantage of the discounts, so just enough time to browse and think wisely about what sale buys your wardrobe will really benefit from.
