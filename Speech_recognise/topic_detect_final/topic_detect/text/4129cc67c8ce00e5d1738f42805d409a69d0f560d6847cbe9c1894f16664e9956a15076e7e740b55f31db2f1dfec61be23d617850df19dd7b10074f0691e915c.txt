Anticipating the blockbuster status of the film, the makers reportedly have incorporated a new profit-sharing model for the film. After a long time, Bollywood will see a major release like Tiger Vs Pathaan where two leading actors of equal popularity will be collaborating onscreen. A Bollywood Hungama report claimed that the makers have decided that SRK and Salman Khan will earn 40% of the film's profit while YRF will bag 20%.

The source was quoted saying, "While 20% may seem too little but it’ll still mean a lot of moolah (money) given the anticipated size of the profits. Tiger vs Pathaan will surely be a bigger hit. This means the profits will also be bigger.”

The report also added that it is standard practice for big actors to charge 60% or 70% of profits and with SRK and Salman Khan on board, "the remuneration also used to be skewed. Both deserve equal pay. And they both are big and hence, it’s no wonder that the lion’s share of the profits will go into their pockets.”

Currently, fans are eagerly waiting for the release of Salman Khan's next Tiger installment. The film also stars Katrina Kaif and is expected to hit the big screen on 10 November 2023. He will also be seen in the April 2023 release Kisi Ka Bhai Kisi Ki Jaan. Meanwhile, SRK is gearing up for the release of Dhunki and Jawaan.
