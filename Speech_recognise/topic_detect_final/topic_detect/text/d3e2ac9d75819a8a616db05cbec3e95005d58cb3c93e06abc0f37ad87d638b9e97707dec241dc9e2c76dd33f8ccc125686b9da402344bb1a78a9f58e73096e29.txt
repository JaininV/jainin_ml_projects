I think this is normal. When you begin, you’re really excited and because it can take a while to get out the door for that first time, it feels so powerful and so much fun. As you get more used to it, that initial excitement wears off. I think that’s ok. I think taking a break from dressing up can make it a lot more fun. I usually don’t get to dress in the summer, and after the break I always find some of those “beginner” feelings coming back.

Whatever your experience, I think it’s important to not feel like there’s some kind of standard or expectation. If you dress up once a year and just look at yourself in the mirror or lounge around the house, that’s fine if that’s all the more you want. If you like going out for drives in the evening a couple of times a month, that’s fine too if that’s what you enjoy. If you like to go to work a couple of times a week en femme and enjoy it, that’s ok and not any more “real” than anyone else’s strategy.

Sometimes, when we share our stories and experiences, or read the experiences of others, we can get the idea that there’s some kind of standard or right way to do this. If you want to dress up and go out, then do it. If you don’t want to, that’s fine. From personal experience, I don’t think most of us ever have to worry about those peak feelings disappearing forever, but the experience certainly changes with time. It’s normal for our emotions to change and fluctuate about everything.

Most importantly, everyone is welcome here, no matter how you dress up.
