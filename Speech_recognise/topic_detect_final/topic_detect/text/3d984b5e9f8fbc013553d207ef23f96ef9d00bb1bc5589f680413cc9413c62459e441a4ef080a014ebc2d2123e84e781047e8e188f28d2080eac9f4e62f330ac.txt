Netizens are debating which look they prefer for NMIXX‘s Sullyoon.

Comparing her visuals with and without double eyelid tape, her deep set eyelids with the eyelid tape give her doll-like appearance.

Her eyelids become significantly bigger and more even.

Without the eyelid tape, however, her natural charms are more prevalent.

Her different eyelids are part of what makes her unique.

Whichever look you prefer, Sullyoon is gorgeous both with and without the accessory!
