If your wife mistakenly cheats on you, pray for her – Actress Bukunmi Oluwasina

Nollywood actress, Bukunmi Oluwasina has warned Nigerian men against divorcing their spouses for ‘mistakenly’ cheating on them.

Infidelity has been the major reason for most divorce cases in Nigeria, especially in the entertainment industry.

In a video message shared on her Instagram page, Oluwasina advised Nigerian men to explore other options such as praying for their unfaithful wives instead of seeking divorce.

She said even if a woman gets pregnant from an extramarital affair, her husband shouldn’t throw her out but accept her and the pregnancy, adding that every child is a blessing.

The mother of one said, “Welcome the child into the family and build your home. Every child is a blessing.

“If your wife is sleeping around, please pray for her. Enter war room. It might be spiritual. She might be going through a lot. What God cannot do does not exist.”
