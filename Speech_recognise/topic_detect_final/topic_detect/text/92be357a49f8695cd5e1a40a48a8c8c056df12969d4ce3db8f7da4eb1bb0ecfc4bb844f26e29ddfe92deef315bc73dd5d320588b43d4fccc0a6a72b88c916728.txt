TUESDAY, April 18, 2023 (HealthDay News) — For women undergoing hysterectomy for benign conditions, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) is associated with an increased risk for adverse outcomes, according to a study published online April 18 in the Annals of Internal Medicine.

Mathilde Gottschau, M. D., Ph.D., from the Danish Cancer Society Research Centre in Copenhagen, and colleagues compared long-term outcomes in women aged 20 years and older with and without BSO during hysterectomy for benign conditions using data from a population-based cohort. Data were included for 142,985 women with hysterectomy for a benign condition: 22,974 and 120,011 with and without BSO, respectively.

The researchers found that women with BSO who were younger than 45 years at surgery had a higher 10-year cumulative risk for hospitalization for cardiovascular disease than those without BSO (risk difference [RD], 1.19 percentage points). At ages 45 to 54, 55 to 64, and 65 years or older, women with BSO had a higher 10-year cumulative risk for cancer (RDs, 0.73, 1.92, and 2.54 percentage points, respectively). In all age groups, women with BSO had higher 10-year mortality, although the differences were significant for ages 45 to 54 years only (RD, 0.79 percentage points). For women aged 65 years and older, mortality at 20 years was inconsistent with that at 10 years.

“The lack of a clear survival benefit and the cancer excess in postmenopausal women suggest the need for a cautious approach when deciding whether to perform BSO at hysterectomy in these women,” the authors write.
