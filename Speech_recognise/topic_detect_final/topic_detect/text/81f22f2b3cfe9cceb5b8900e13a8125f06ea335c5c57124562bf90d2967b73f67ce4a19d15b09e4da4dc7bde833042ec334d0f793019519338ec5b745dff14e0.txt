SEATTLE (AP) — Willy Adames drove in the go-ahead run for Milwaukee in the top of the 11th inning and the Brewers defeated the Seattle Mariners on Tuesday night, 6-5.

Joey Weimer scored on Adames’ RBI groundout to shortstop against Mariners reliever Justin Topa (0-1). Adames finished the night with two hits and three RBI, with a run scoring double in the third and a solo homer in the sixth.

The Mariners are now 0-4 in extra innings this season after going a combined 25-12 in extras the previous two seasons.

Seattle erased the deficit with a four run bottom of the third, as Cal Raleigh hit a two-run double, Teoscar Hernández hit a sacrifice fly, and Tommy La Stella blooped an RBI single into left field to put the Mariners ahead before Adames tied it again in the sixth.
