Wordsmith and broadcaster Kel Richards says the word “dog act” is getting ready to be put in the next edition of the Australian National Dictionary.

“I was talking to Mark Quinn at the Australian National Dictionary Centre today and he’s getting ready for the next edition of the Australian National Dictionary,” Mr Richards told Sky News host Peta Credlin.

“Because it is that kind of new word.”
