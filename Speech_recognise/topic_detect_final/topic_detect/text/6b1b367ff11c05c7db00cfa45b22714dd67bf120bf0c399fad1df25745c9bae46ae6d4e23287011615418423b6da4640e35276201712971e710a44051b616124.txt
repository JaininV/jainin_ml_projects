BALLSTON SPA — Stewart’s Shops will be closing its store at 404 Geyser Road in Milton later this month to refocus its efforts on other nearby locations, the convenience store chain announced Tuesday.

The Saratoga County shop’s last day of business will be Sunday, April 30. But local Stewart’s enthusiasts, fear not: the other, larger location less than a half-mile down the street at 448 Geyser Road will be unaffected by the closure.

A Stewart's spokesperson said that while it wasn't always part of the plan, the company decided to close the location after examining traffic with both stores in such close proximity to one another.

“In most areas, Stewart’s Shops have the space to be the community grocery store, restaurant and gas station and this shop cannot expand to fit those needs,” said company president Gary Dake in a statement. “It is always difficult to close a shop, and we would like to thank all our loyal customers for their business.”

Stewart’s Shops emphasized that the closure does not reflect a downward trend for the company’s growth. This year, the family-owned business will invest another $50 million to construct nine new shops and eight rebuilt shops, which will replace older, smaller locations like the one closing in Milton. A number of remodels and additions will also be completed, the company says.

According to a legal notice, a proposal by Stewart's to renovate the Marion Avenue store in Saratoga Springs goes before a Zoning Board of Appeals hearing at 6:30 p.m. Monday, April 24. An area variance will be required. See the city website for more information, www. Saratoga-springs.org.
