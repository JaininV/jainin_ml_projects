Singapore’s Education Minister, Chan Chun Sing said that the republic must value diverse talents and move away from using static metrics such as examination grades and differentiations between degree and diploma holders. He added that this would be one of the key areas the government was focusing on to keep the country’s meritocracy resilient and sustainable.

Speaking in Parliament, Mr Chan highlighted ongoing efforts such as the shift to full subject-based banding which will be implemented next year, replacing the existing Express, Normal (Academic) and Normal (Technical) streams. Under the new system, students will have greater flexibility to study subjects at levels that suit their interests, aptitudes and learning needs.
