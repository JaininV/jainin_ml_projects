We are all aware that the Sun, the largest object in our solar system, is enraged and might hit Earth with one of the most catastrophic solar storms. The last solar storm that struck Earth only a week ago had only minor impacts, but the one to come might be much more damaging.

The first hit is projected to occur today, April 19, 2023, and April 20, according to NASA. The US space agency thinks this encounter with Earth may be more harmful.

A large coronal mass ejection (CME) that is journeying toward Earth is the cause of this solar storm. Since the cloud is traveling in the form of a crescent, indirect blows should occur before direct hits.

This limited strike could, however, have unsettling repercussions. According to reports, it may weaken the Earth's magnetic fields enough to produce cracks in them, allowing a CME to get into the upper atmosphere and trigger a much more violent storm.

Today's solar storms can be pretty dangerous. It can interfere with GPS, impair mobile and internet connections, and even ruin power grids, resulting in a significant power outage. Even the electronic equipment on Earth is susceptible to failure.

Ready for #aurora? A #solarstorm direct hit is coming. NASA predicts impact 20 April. Additional glancing storms launched earlier mean activity could pick up late on April 19. Expect extended aurora at high latitudes with good chance of views down to mid-latitudes by the 20th. pic.twitter.com/GV8tMf55k3

We should also be prepared for auroras in the next few days, according to Tamitha Skov, commonly known as Space Weather Woman, a physicist who analyses various weather phenomena.
