At least four people were killed and several others were injured in a shooting at a birthday party on Saturday night in an Alabama city, officials said.

Sgt. Jeremy Burkett, a spokesman for the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency, said at a news conference on Sunday that the shooting in Dadeville took place around 10:34 p.m. and that there were a “multitude of injuries.”

“This is going to be a long, complicated process,” said Sergeant Burkett, who did not provide information on a motive for the shooting or specify how many people were injured. Officials did not take questions at the news conference.
