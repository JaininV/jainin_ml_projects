With Sikh diaspora participating in 35th Australian Sikh Games held at Gold Coast in Brisbane, Australia, PM Modi made sure to extend his wishes for the games and termed it a great motivation for Indian youth living in Australia. Notably, the Indian national flag was also hoisted for the first time in the 35-year history of the games. The participants were filled with the spirit of patriotism when the tricolour was hoisted at the stadium. Responding to PMâ€™s wishes, the Sikh community in Canada thanked PM Modi for his token of appreciation.
