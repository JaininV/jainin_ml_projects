Reliable journalist Fabrizio Romano has revealed why Liverpool have approached the agent of Ryan Gravenberch, despite Bayern Munich’s intention to keep the midfielder.

Following the disappointment of the Reds pulling out of the race to sign Borussia Dortmund star Jude Bellingham, the club have instead been linked with numerous other players.

One midfielder reliably linked with a move to Anfield recently has been Bayern youngster Gravenberch.

The Merseyside outfit have enquired about a potential move in the summer, and the 20-year-old seems open to the idea.

However, Romano has shared an update regarding the Bavaria’s attitude to a transfer – slightly dampening the positivity surrounding the deal’s progression.

“Ryan Gravenberch wants to play more, this is why Liverpool approached his agent,” wrote Romano on Twitter.

“But Bayern have no intention to negotiate.

“Bayern position is very clear: they want to keep Gravenberch, feeling shared by the board and Tuchel.

Although the German giants seem intent on keeping Gravenberch at the Allianz Arena, the player’s desire to move could impact the situation.

At the moment, the 20-year-old – who only arrived from Ajax last summer – has not been playing as regularly as he would have liked.

Although he has made 18 appearances in the Bundesliga this term, the Dutchman has only started one league game.

Arriving in Germany as one of the hottest prospects in European football, Gravenberch will have been put out by his lack of minutes – something he was presumably promised before signing.

At Liverpool, he could be afforded a regular place in Jurgen Klopp’s starting XI.

Therefore, if he did push through a move with a transfer request, it may be hard for Bayern to keep hold of the player.
