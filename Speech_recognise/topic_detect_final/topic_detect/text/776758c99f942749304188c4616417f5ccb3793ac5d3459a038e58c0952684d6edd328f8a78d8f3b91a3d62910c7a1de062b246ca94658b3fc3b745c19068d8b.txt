The Sing At Wings Promotion has been underway for quite some time and we've got two High Schools that will be duking it out in a battle of votes to see who will be hitting the stage in Kalamazoo with Foreigner on May 19th at the Wings Event Center to sing "I Wanna Know What Love Is" in front of a packed crowd. Not only that but the band will be gifting $500 to the winning program.

There are two high schools that have chosen to stand out from the rest. The first was Pennfield High School in Battle Creek which chose to take on a song by Aerosmith, Dream On, whereas Portage Northern opted to go for the song they hope to be singing on stage with Foreigner, I Wanna Know What Love Is.
