NHL players will play through almost anything to in their quest to win a Stanley Cup, and Winnipeg Jets forward Morgan Barron gave us the latest wild example on Tuesday night.

Barron had to leave Tuesday's Game 1 against the Vegas Golden Knights after being hit in the face by a skate. That injury required 75 stitches and did not stop him from returning to the game in the second period.

You can see the play that injured him here.
