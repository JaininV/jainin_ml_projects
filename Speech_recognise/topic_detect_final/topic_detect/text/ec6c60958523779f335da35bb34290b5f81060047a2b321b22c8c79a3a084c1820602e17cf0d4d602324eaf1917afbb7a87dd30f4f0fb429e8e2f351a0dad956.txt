Before attempting any other solutions, try restarting your Apple Watch. This simple step can often resolve minor issues like the Apple logo freezing on the screen.

Press and hold the side button until the Power Off slider appears.

Drag the slider to the right to turn off the watch.

Wait for 30 seconds, then press and hold the side button again until the Apple logo appears.

If restarting doesn’t work, a hard reset may be the next solution to try. This action forces the watch to restart, which can help resolve more stubborn issues.

Press and hold both the Digital Crown and the side button simultaneously.

Keep holding both buttons until the screen goes black and the Apple logo reappears.

Release the buttons once the logo is visible.

Ensure your Apple Watch has enough battery power by placing it on its charger for at least 30 minutes. If the watch is still stuck on the Apple logo after charging, try using a different charger to rule out any cable faults.

Updating the watchOS can sometimes fix issues like the Apple logo freezing. To update your Apple Watch, follow these steps:

Make sure your iPhone is connected to Wi-Fi and your Apple Watch is connected to your iPhone via Bluetooth.

Open the Watch app on your iPhone.

If an update is available, tap Download and Install.

Enter your iPhone and Apple Watch passcodes if prompted.

Wait for the update to finish. Do not restart or unpair your watch during the update.</li

Unpairing and then re-pairing your Apple Watch with your iPhone can help resolve issues caused by software or settings conflicts.

Open the Watch app on your iPhone.

Tap My Watch, then tap the (i) icon next to your Apple Watch.

Wait for the unpairing process to complete.

To re-pair your Apple Watch, open the Watch app on your iPhone and follow the on-screen instructions.

Ensure that your Apple Watch’s accessibility settings aren’t causing the issue. Check the VoiceOver settings by following these steps:

Open the Watch app on your iPhone.

Make sure VoiceOver is turned off. If it’s on, tap the toggle to turn it off.

Using the Find My service can help resolve the Apple logo issue by sending a sound to your watch, which may prompt it to restart.

Open the Find My app on your iPhone or visit iCloud.com/find on a computer.

Select your Apple Watch from the list of devices.

Tap Play Sound and wait for the sound to play on your Apple Watch.

If all else fails, you can try completely draining the Apple Watch battery. This process can force the watch to restart once you recharge it.

Remove the Apple Watch from its charger and let it run until the battery is completely drained.

Once the watch is fully drained, place it back on the charger and wait for it to turn on automatically.

If the Apple logo issue is resolved, your watch should start up normally.

If you’ve tried all the above solutions and your Apple Watch is still stuck on the Apple logo, it’s time to contact Apple Support. They can help you diagnose the issue and, if necessary, provide information on repairs or replacements.
