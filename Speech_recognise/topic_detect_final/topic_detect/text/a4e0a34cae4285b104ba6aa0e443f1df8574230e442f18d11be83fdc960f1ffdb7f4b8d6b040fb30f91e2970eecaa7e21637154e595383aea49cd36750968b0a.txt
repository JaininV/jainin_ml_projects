Nigerian man has taken to social media to make a startling revelation about his escapades with prostitutes.

In a post he made on popular forum, Nairaland, the man wrote that since he started sleeping with prostitutes in 2010, he has slept with 155 of them and a tangible of them without protection.

I have come to the conclusion that I’m addicted to prostitutes. It started in 2010 when I first slept with a hooker. Its 13yrs now and I still patronise prostitutes. I slept with 155 of them, 55 were without protection.

The problem right now is that I don’t have that much feelings for the new girl I’m dating. Since she’s been in my life I have been able to stop but I noticed my soul still longs to experience that feeling of getting high and banging a hoxx.

In fact, I’m thinking if ending this relationship should be my next line of action.

This is not the first time, my past relationships ended because the feelings weren’t there.

What would you suggest? Does sleeping with many partners make one loose the feeling of love? I don’t get it, I can’t even love, it’s not just there.
