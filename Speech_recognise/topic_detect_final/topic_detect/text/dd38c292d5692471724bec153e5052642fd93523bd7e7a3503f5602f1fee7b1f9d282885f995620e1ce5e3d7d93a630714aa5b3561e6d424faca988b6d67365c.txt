The distinct meteorological characterizations were exhibited in the two seasons. As shown in Figs. 2 and S10, the temperature behavior was characterized by higher values in the monsoon season (10.4±4.1 ∘C) and lower values in the pre-monsoon season (3.1±3.6 ∘C) with an average value of 5.3±5.1 ∘C. The relative humidity (RH) seems very similar in the two seasons (50±21 % in the pre-monsoon season vs. 48±19 % in the monsoon season), but the water content (HO) in the air during the monsoon season (1.0±0.2 %) was clearly higher than that in the pre-monsoon season (0.6±0.2 %), which reflected the wetter environment in the monsoon period. The wind speed (WS) was comparable during the two seasons, which was 4.2±2.7 m s−1 in the pre-monsoon season and

4.5±2.7 m s−1 in the monsoon season, respectively. The wind direction (WD) showed a clear divergence, with westerly and southwesterly winds prevailing in the pre-monsoon season, and southerly winds prevailing in the monsoon season (Fig. S11). The frequencies of air masses arriving at the observation station from various directions during the two seasons are shown in Fig. S12. In the pre-monsoon season, strong westerlies pass through western Nepal, northwestern India and Pakistan (i.e., southern Himalayas). In the monsoon season, air masses were more derived from Bangladesh and northeastern India and brought moisture that originated in the Bay of Bengal. The seasonality of meteorology was generally in agreement with the previous studies in the TP, which is strongly influenced by the large-scale Asian monsoon circulation (Cong et al., 2015; Bonasoni et al., 2010).

As a background high-altitude site on the TP, the Nam Co station displayed a low particle concentration. On average PM was 1.8±1.0 µg m−3, which was similar to PM (2 µg m−3) measured by a high-resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer at the Nam Co station in 2015 (J. Xu et al., 2018). The particulate matter concentration at the Nam Co station was lower than the PM

observed at Qomolangma Station (4.4 µg m−3) on the southern TP and Waliguan Observatory (9.1 µg m−3) on the northeastern TP, which resulted from a much longer transport distance of anthropogenic emissions compared with Qomolangma Station and Waliguan Observatory (Zhang et al., 2021). The average concentration of BC was

223±135 ng m−3 during the whole measurement period, which is comparable with previous observations (J. Xu et al., 2018, 2020; Wang et al., 2016; R. Xu et al., 2018), and represents the background level in the TP region. The average O concentration was 58±15 ppbv, which was similar to the results from some high-elevation sites in the TP (Bonasoni et al., 2010; Shang et al., 2018) and higher than the results from Beijing during spring (Chen et al., 2020). Consistent with previous research (J. Xu et al., 2018; Cong et al., 2015; Yin et al., 2021), higher PM, BC and O concentrations were found during the pre-monsoon season (Fig. S13). The higher BC and PM may result from the active biomass-burning emissions in the pre-monsoon season on the southern TP (Cong et al., 2015). The higher O concentrations in the pre-monsoon season were primarily attributed to stratospheric intrusion of ozone (Yin et al., 2021). In contrast, there was no noticeable difference in CO between the two seasons, and the average concentration was

0.12±0.14 ppmv.

Higher frequency of new particle formation in the monsoon season

Figure 2g shows the evolution of PNSD for the entire study. It can be seen that NPF events in the monsoon period were observed almost every day (8 NPF days and 2 undefined days, 80 %), while the frequency of NPF events was extremely low during the pre-monsoon period (4 in 27 d, 15 %). As shown in Table 1, the event frequency at the Nam Co station during the monsoon season was higher than the result reported at NCO-P site on the southern TP in the monsoon season (57 %) (Venzac et al., 2008), and similar to the frequency reported at Mt. Daban on the northeastern TP in the post-monsoon season (80 %) (Du et al., 2015). The frequency at the Nam Co station during the pre-monsoon season was lower than that at NCO-P (38 %) (Venzac et al., 2008) and comparable with that at Mt. Yulong on the southeastern TP (14 %) (Shang et al., 2018) in the same season. In addition, the NPF frequencies of other high-altitude sites, such as Mt. Tai (Lv et al., 2018), Jungfraujoch (Tröstl et al., 2016b), Maïdo Observatory (Rose et al., 2019) and Storm Peak Laboratory (Hallar et al., 2011), were basically between those in the pre-monsoon and monsoon seasons of the Nam Co station. In general, the frequencies of the two seasons at the Nam Co station can represent the highest and lowest values of NPF frequencies observed in the TP and other high-altitude sites, and even various environments (such as urban, rural, etc.) (Nieminen et al., 2018).

Table 1 summarizes the formation rate (J), growth rate (GR), and condensation sink (CS) at the Nam Co station and other high-altitude sites. The J at the Nam Co station varied from 0.38 to 2.43 cm−3 s−1, with an average value of 1.15±0.58 cm−3 s−1, which is comparable with the results at Mt. Yulong (J, 1.18 cm−3 s−1) (Shang et al., 2018) and Jungfraujoch (J, 0.2–7.5 cm−3 s−1) (Tröstl et al., 2016b). However, the J at the Nam Co station was higher than the values at NCO-P site (J, 0.14–0.19 cm−3 s−1) (Venzac et al., 2008) and Storm Peak Laboratory (J, 0.39-1.19 cm−3 s−1) (Hallar et al., 2011), but lower than that at Mt. Tai (J, 1.33–52.54 cm−3 s−1) (Lv et al., 2018) and Maïdo Observatory (J, 0.5–30 cm−3 s−1) (Rose et al., 2019), which may be due to the distinction of particle size range used in the calculation and precursor concentrations between the sites. For example, SO at Mt. Tai (3.2 ppb) (Lv et al., 2018) was much higher than that at Mt. Yulong (0.06 ppb) (Shang et al., 2018). The average GR in the size range of 4–25 nm at the Nam Co station varied from 1.5 to 5.6 nm h−1, with the average value of 4.0±1.2 nm h−1, which is comparable with those at Mt. Yulong (3.2 nm h−1) (Shang et al., 2018) and Jungfraujoch (4.0 nm h−1) (Tröstl et al., 2016b), and higher than those at NCO-P site (1.8±0.7 nm h−1) (Venzac et al., 2008) and Mt. Daban (2.0 nm h−1) (Du et al., 2015), but lower than that at Maïdo Observatory (8–45 nm h−1) (Rose et al., 2019). The average CS was

0.0015±0.0007 s−1 at the Nam Co station, which is comparable with those at Mt. Yulong (0.0002 s−1) (Shang et al., 2018), Maïdo Observatory (0.0002–0.02 s−1) (Rose et al., 2019) and Storm Peak Laboratory (0.0012 s−1) (Hallar et al., 2011), and much lower than that at Mt. Tai (0.011–0.048 s−1) (Lv et al., 2018). In a word, the J, GR, and CS at the Nam Co station were within average levels in the high-altitude sites. Meanwhile, there was no significant variation in J, GR and daily CS between the pre-monsoon and monsoon seasons, although the NPF frequencies of the two seasons were quite different. The key factors determining the occurrence of NPF events need to be further studied.

Whether an NPF event can occur is mainly related to (1) the CS, which mainly referred to the scavenging rate of precursors, clusters, and newly formed particles by background aerosols. High CS can lead to the continual reduction in newly formed particle number concentration and inhibit the occurrence of NPF, (2) the gaseous precursors that can participate in nucleation and growth, including sulfuric acid (Kulmala et al., 2013), dimethylamine (Yao et al., 2018), ammonia (Xiao et al., 2015) and VOC (Tröstl et al., 2016a; Fang et al., 2020; Qiao et al., 2021). A sufficiently high concentration of low-volatility vapors (precursors) can contribute to persistent nucleation and generating new atmospheric particles; (3) air mass origins and meteorological factors including WD, RH, temperature, the intensity of solar radiation, etc, which can influence the occurrence and intensity of NPF events by directly or indirectly affecting the source and sink parameters.

In the following, those potential reasons will be examined. For clarity, NPF event days occurring in the pre-monsoon and monsoon seasons were named NPF-pre days and NPF-monsoon days, respectively. Non-event days in the pre-monsoon season were termed non-event days, as non-event days in the monsoon season were scarce.

CS is the key factor controlling the occurrence of NPF events especially in urban environment (Yan et al., 2021). At some high-altitude observations at a larger scale, the important role of the transported pre-existing particles in NPF events was also emphasized (Rose et al., 2019; Boulon et al., 2010). Here we analyzed the CS levels in NPF days and non-event days at the Nam Co station. As shown in Fig. 3a, the levels of CS in NPF-pre days, NPF-monsoon days and non-event days were approximate during 11:00–18:00 GMT+8 (the occurrence time of NPF events), although the CS in the early morning of NPF-pre days seems to be slightly lower. The CS was mainly in the range of 0.001–0.0015 s−1 during the NPF occurrence time, which was much lower than that at most locations in China, such as ∼0.01 s−1

in urban Beijing (Deng et al., 2021), and 0.001–0.284 s−1 at Mt. Tai (Lv et al., 2018), and comparable with that at Mt. Yulong (0.002 s−1) (Shang et al., 2018). The result varied from previous studies which reported much lower CS during NPF days than that in non-event days (Zhou et al., 2021; Lv et al., 2018). It indicated that CS was not the decisive factor controlling the occurrence of NPF events at the Nam Co station.

Gaseous sulfuric acid is identified as the key precursor for nucleation and initial growth due to its low volatility (Kulmala et al., 2013; Qiao et al., 2021). Nucleation based on sulfuric acid and stabilizing species, such as ammonia and amines, is regarded as the dominant NPF mechanism in urban and rural environments. However, the role of gaseous sulfuric acid in NPF events may not be significant at the Nam Co station. The concentration of sulfuric acid in the atmosphere is related to the degree of SO, photochemical oxidation rate and CS. On the one hand, the level of SO was considered to be comparable between NPF days and non-event days or maybe higher in non-event days. The SO concentration was not measured directly in the observation periods, and the WRF/CMAQ-modeled SO concentration was employed for analysis. It can be found that the modeled SO

concentration in the area was at a very low level, with the average value of

0.03±0.02 ppb (Fig. S14), which was comparable with that measured at Mt. Yulong (Shang et al., 2018). For NPF and non-event days, slightly higher modeled SO concentration was observed on non-event days and NPF-pre days compared with those on NPF-monsoon days. It indicates that the level of SO may be related to the seasonal influence, and there is no significant difference between NPF days and non-event days. On the other hand, the photochemical oxidation intensities of SO and CS were comparable between NPF days and non-event days. The photochemical oxidation intensity of SO was indicated by J (O1D). As shown in Fig. 3b, NPF-pre days, NPF-monsoon days and non-event days shared the same level of J (O1D) (– s−1) during the occurrence time of NPF events. The CS levels were close among those three types of days as introduced in Sect. 3.3.1. With speculated comparable/lower SO

concentrations and similar CS and J (O1D) levels, the abundance of gaseous sulfuric acid in NPF days would be approaching or a little lower than that on non-event days. In any case, it indicated that sulfuric acid may not govern the occurrence of NPF events at Nam Co station.

In addition to sulfuric acid, organics are also considered to be an important factor of NPF events. Observations and laboratory experiments have found that organics may participate in or even dominate the nucleation and growth process in NPF events in pristine environments and the preindustrial atmosphere. For example, CLOUD (Cosmics Leaving Outdoor Droplets) experiments observed obvious NPF events from highly oxidized organics without the involvement of sulfuric acid (Kirkby et al., 2016). At the high-altitude sites of Jungfraujoch and Himalaya, NPF events occurred mainly through the condensation of highly oxygenated molecules (HOMs) (Bianchi et al., 2016, 2021). Due to instrument status, VOC measurement was only available in the pre-monsoon season. The concentration of VOC (total VOC) showed a higher value (20 %) during 11:00–18:00 on NPF-pre days compared with non-event days (Fig. 3c). Aromatics, which can be used as the indicator of anthropogenic emissions, also exhibited a higher level (20 %) during NPF-pre days (Fig. 3d). The aromatics have been considered to contribute substantially to new particle formation (Molteni et al., 2018). The potential NPF precursors such as toluene (Garmash et al., 2020), styrene (Yu et al., 2022) and trimethylbenzene (Molteni et al., 2018) showed higher values in NPF-pre days compared with those in non-event days (Fig. S15). This suggested that VOC such as aromatics may be the key factor in determining the occurrence of NPF events. In order to further evaluate the role of VOC, we used WRF/CMAQ models to simulate the spatial distribution of VOC concentration in the pre-monsoon and monsoon seasons. The detailed information about the model setting and evaluation can be found in Sect. S2. As shown in Fig. 4, the simulated VOC levels in NPF days including NPF-pre and NPF-monsoon days were higher than those in non-event days. The average modeled VOC concentrations in NPF-pre days and NPF-monsoon days were 25 % and 88 % higher than those in non-event days, respectively. Therefore, we further considered that the organic matter could be the key factor to determine whether NPF event occurred. Nucleation of pure organics or organics involved could be the dominant mechanism at the Nam Co station. In addition, higher organic concentrations were observed in the monsoon season (NPF-monsoon days) compared with that in the pre-monsoon season (NPF-pre days and non-event days). The result is consistent with one recent study which has found that the concentration of monoterpene-derived HOMs in East Asia was higher in summer (June–August) than that in Spring (March–May) by using GEOS-Chem global chemical transport model (Xu et al., 2022). This means that the frequent NPF events in the monsoon season could be caused by the higher organic matters.

While the concentrations of organic precursors could be the most probable reasons for the occurrence of NPF events, the external factors driving the difference in VOC levels between the NPF and non-event days and other conditions that may affect the characteristics of NPF were still unknown. This indicated that a further investigation into other NPF-related variables was still required.

There are almost no local anthropogenic source emissions at the Nam Co station. Air pollutants at the observation site are mainly brought by air mass transmission. Backward trajectories were utilized to identify the air mass origins associated with NPF events. The frequencies of the 48 h back trajectories of air masses arriving at the Nam Co station during the occurrence time of nucleation (11:00–18:00) in non-event days, NPF-pre days and NPF-monsoon days are presented in Fig. 5. It can be found that the dominant air masses on non-event days were from the west (almost 100 %) and passed by western Nepal, northwestern India and Pakistan. In comparison, air masses in NPF-pre days and NPF-monsoon days mainly come from the south and southwest (57 % and 75 %) and originated in the northeastern India. WD, which can reflect the local situation for air masses and the source of air pollutants, showed a high frequency of strong southerly wind on NPF-pre days and NPF-monsoon days and westerly wind on non-event days (Fig. S16). The example of the spatial distribution of wind field in non-event days, NPF-pre days and NPF-monsoon days displayed the similar phenomenon on a larger scale (Fig. S17). These results suggested that the occurrence of NPF events was related to the southerly and southwesterly air masses. When the southerly air mass occurred, it may bring organic precursors from the southern region (northeastern India) to the Nam Co station, driving the occurrence of NPF events in this area. As for the significantly higher NPF frequency in the monsoon season, it resulted from the more frequent southerly air masses (summer monsoon) in the monsoon season in comparison with the pre-monsoon season as introduced in Sect. 3.1. The summer monsoon can bring the higher organic concentrations in the monsoon season (NPF-monsoon days) compared with those in the pre-monsoon season (NPF-pre and non-event days) (Fig. 4), thus triggering almost daily NPF events. A similar result was found in the recent study which showed that the Indian summer monsoon acted as a facilitator for transporting gaseous pollutants (Yin et al., 2021).

In Fig. 6, we show the diurnal variations of meteorological factors during NPF-pre days, NPF-monsoon days and non-event days at the Nam Co station. The temperatures on NPF-pre days and non-event days were generally close, but the temperature on NPF-monsoon days was obviously higher. The similar temperature on NPF-pre days and non-event days suggests that temperature is not a crucial factor for NPF event occurrence. Previous studies have found that higher temperature can increase the formation rate of HOMs but reduce the volatility of HOMs in the meantime. The effect of temperature on the nucleation rate may not be important in a limited ambient temperature range (Stolzenburg et al., 2018). But the higher temperature during NPF-monsoon days may promote biogenic VOC emissions, which favored particle nucleation and growth (Andreae et al., 2022). This may partly explain the phenomenon for the higher modeled VOC concentration on NPF-monsoon days than NPF-pre days. The average RH was similar on both NPF days and non-event days, although NPF-pre days had a wide range of RH changes. Laboratory studies have shown that water vapor can suppress the formation of extremely low volatility organic compounds (ELVOCs) from monoterpenes (Bonn et al., 2002). However, our result was the opposite. During 11:00–18:00, the water content (HO) in the air during NPF-monsoon days was the highest, NPF-pre days was the second, and non-event days was the lowest. This indicated the inhibition effect of water vapor was not important at the Nam Co station. The similar finding was also observed at remote sites in the subboreal forest of North America (Andreae et al., 2022).

Overall, our results are most consistent with the organics-involved nucleation mechanism. Condensation sink and gaseous sulfuric acid could have no significant effect on the occurrence of NPF events. The frequent NPF events in the summer monsoon season may result from the higher frequency of southerly and southwesterly air masses, which brought the organic precursors to participate in the NPF process.

Significant increase of CCN in the monsoon season

The CCN concentration was estimated following the method introduced in Sect. 2.5. Considering the similar proportions of chemical components between the Nam Co station and Mt. Yulong with around 70 % fraction of organics, and the stability of the fractions of chemical components (J. Xu et al., 2018) (Shang et al., 2018), the hygroscopicity parameter κ was assumed to be equal to 0.12 throughout the measurement period according to the previous measurement at Mt. Yulong in the TP (Shang et al., 2018). As a result, the

D values at S levels of 0.6 % and 1.2 % were 73.4±1.3 and

46.3±0.8 nm, respectively. No noticeable difference in D was found between the pre-monsoon and monsoon seasons (S=0.6 %:

74.4±1.0 vs. 72.4±1.1 nm, S=1.2 %: 46.9±0.6 vs. 45.7±0.7 nm). There could be uncertainties in the values of

κ due to the variation of chemical components, but they had little impact on D and thus on the final result of CCN concentration.

The high-frequency NPF events in the summer monsoon period markedly increased the number concentration of atmospheric aerosols. The average PNSDs during the pre-monsoon and monsoon seasons are plotted in Fig. 7a with much higher number concentrations observed during the monsoon season. The mean total particle number concentration (PN) in the monsoon season was

3647±2671 cm−3, which was more than 2 times higher than that of the pre-monsoon season (1163±1026 cm−3). Although the measured particle size ranges were not the same as other studies, the results can still be comparable as the background particles were mainly distributed in tens to hundreds of nanometers. As shown in Table 1, PN at the Nam Co station in the pre-monsoon season was comparable with other high-altitude sites around the world, while PN in the monsoon season was much higher due to the frequent NPF events. The atmospheric particles contributed by new particle nucleation and growth in the monsoon season were mainly concentrated below 100 nm. Among them, the concentration of nucleation mode particles (4–25 nm) in the monsoon season was about 2 times higher than that in the pre-monsoon season, and the concentration of Aitken mode particles (25–100 nm) was 3.5 times higher than that in the pre-monsoon season. In contrast, accumulation mode particles (>100 nm) which were related to the secondary formation process (Wang et al., 2013), were nearly at the same level in the two seasons (around 200 cm−3). As for CCN, the average number concentrations of CCN at S of 0.6 % and 1.2 % in the monsoon season were 434±242 and 863±628 cm−3, respectively (Fig. 8). The results were about 0.1 and 0.6 times higher than those in the pre-monsoon season at S of 0.6 % (396±177 cm−3) and 1.2 % (552±261 cm−3).

In addition to the average particle number concentration in the two seasons, the important impact of NPF events is more reflected in the increased number concentration of aerosol and CCN within a few hours after particle nucleation and growth, that is, the aerosol and CCN production. The aerosol production and CCN production during one day can be obtained by comparing the particle number concentration at the beginning of the increase of the target particles (N) with the maximum number concentration (N), as introduced by Rose et al. (2017). The N and N are hourly average concentrations as shown in Fig. S18. Figure 9 shows the average daily variation of PNSD, three-mode particles and CCN in the whole period in the pre-monsoon season and monsoon season. Higher daily aerosol production and CCN production were observed during the monsoon season compared with those in the pre-monsoon season. In the monsoon season, nucleation mode particles (4–25 nm) started to increase quickly at around 11:00 when nucleation occurred. The freshly nucleated particles grew to larger sizes due to condensation and coagulation of the pre-existing particles within several hours, which contributed to the increase of Aitken mode particles (25–100 nm) from 15:00. The average daily aerosol production of nucleation mode particles and Aitken mode particles in the monsoon season was around 3400 and 1200 cm−3, respectively. As for CCN, the average production of CCN at S of 0.6 % and 1.2 % in the monsoon season was 180 and 518 cm−3, respectively. The production of CCN were lower than previous studies because they only considered NPF days and their environment was relatively polluted (Rose et al., 2017; Shen et al., 2016). The production of aerosols and CCN was much lower in the pre-monsoon season, although the particles and CCN at around 11:00 were comparable with the monsoon season. The average daily aerosol production of nucleation mode particles and Aitken mode particles in the pre-monsoon season were around 500 and 300 cm−3, respectively. And the CCN production at S of 0.6 % and 1.2 % was 160 and 286 cm−3, respectively. The average daily production of nucleation mode particles, Aitken mode particles and CCN at S of 1.2 % in the monsoon season was 5.8, 3 and 0.8 times higher than that in the pre-monsoon season, respectively.

It should be noted that the CCN concentration and production we estimated above were local ground levels, which can be considered as the minimum values. That is because those smaller particles ( nm) formed by NPF may further grow and reach CCN size on the following days during transportation, as the coagulation sink affecting the lifetime of aerosols was at a low level. This mechanism was verified at different high-altitude stations such as NCO-P site, Chacaltaya and Jungfraujoch (Venzac et al., 2008; Rose et al., 2015; Tröstl et al., 2016b). The nucleation mode and Aitken mode particle bands in the morning reflected the continuation of NPF events. As a result, the amount of potential CCN in the monsoon season could be much larger than the result measured here, due to the high level of the smaller particles. Therefore, the climate effect from aerosols may have a large variance between the pre-monsoon and monsoon season.
