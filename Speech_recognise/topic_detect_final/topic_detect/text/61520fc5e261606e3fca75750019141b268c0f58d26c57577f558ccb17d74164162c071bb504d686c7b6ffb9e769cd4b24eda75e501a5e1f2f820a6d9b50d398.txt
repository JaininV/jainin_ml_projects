On April 19, Sportsworld reported that Lee Jae Wook will star in the new historical drama “Tangeum” (literal title) as the male lead character Hong Rang. The same day, Xportsnews reported that Jo Bo Ah will also join the drama as the female lead Jae Yi.

In response to the reports, Lee Jae Wook’s agency C-JeS Studios and Jo Bo Ah’s agency Keyeast each remarked that they are reviewing the offers to star in the drama.

Based on the novel of the same name, “Tangeum” is a mystery romance drama about Jae Yi, the daughter born between danju (the owner of a merchants guild in the Joseon Dynasty) Shim Yeol Guk and a surrogate woman, and Hong Rang, Shim Yeol Guk’s son born through his wife. Director Kim Hong Seon, who helmed “Decoy: part 1” and “Decoy: part 2,” “The Guest,” “The Voice,” and “Money Heist: Korea – Joint Economic Area,” will be in charge of production.
