The government of Oyo state has vowed to deal mercilessly with criminal elements perpetrating recruitment scams with the sole intent of defrauding unsuspecting members of the public.

A purported list has been trending on social media claiming that the State Universal Basic Education Board had commenced its recruitment process.

The board Chairman, Nureni Adeniran, in a statement, urged the public to be vigilant and never deal with scammers who pose as recruitment agents for the board.

He said the management had also begun moves to identify those perpetrating the fraudulent activities, promising to hand them over to the appropriate authorities if caught.

Adeniran said, “On repeated occasions, we have cautioned the general public to be vigilant and circumspect not to deal with scammers who pose as recruitment agents or staff members of OYOSUBEB. They collect huge sums of money from unsuspecting victims with the promise to provide them employment at OYOSUBEB.

“Today, we saw a list of names published by some fraudulent people, claiming those are the people invited for the OYOSUBEB job interview.

On the list, their interview was scheduled for Tuesday, April 18 and Wednesday, April 19, 2023 at an unknown venue. We are on it and anyone caught disseminating this kind of information will be dealt with, according to the law.

“When OYOSUBEB plans to expand its workforce and seek to recruit competent hands to carry out the task of improving the state’s education sector, the public can rest assured that we would follow appropriate channels and processes in doing so; including advertisements on public channels of communication, followed by rigorous screening, interviews and examination exercises,” the chairman said.
