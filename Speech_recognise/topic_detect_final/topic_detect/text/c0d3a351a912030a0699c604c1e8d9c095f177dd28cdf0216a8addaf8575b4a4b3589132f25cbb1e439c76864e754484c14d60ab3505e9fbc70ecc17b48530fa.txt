Hughes High School has hired Mike Hill as its next head boys basketball coach.

Hill is a Cincinnati native, graduating from Western Hills High School in 2009.

Hill spent the last year as the head coach of Shroder High School. He has seven years of coaching experience, running his own AAU program, Nati Elite. His AAU program runs from ages 5-17 years old.

Hill works with City Gospel Mission helping youth find career and college opportunities after high school. He and his wife, Arieanna, help at-risk youth who are neglected.

Hughes was 9-16 last year and has not had a winning season in three years, since winning the Cincinnati Metro Athletic Conference Red Division championship and finishing 20-6 overall.

“I’m extremely excited and honored to become the new head coach at Hughes,” Hill said in a school press release. “It’s a prestigious program that has been built over the years and I’m looking forward to continuing to build from the foundation that was put here before me. Our young men here at Hughes will be known for their hard work and discipline on and off the court.”

Hill went to Cincinnati Christian University, graduating in 2014 with a degree in Biblical studies and a minor in sports administration.

In his senior year at CCU, he led the team in scoring averaging 19.9 points per game ultimately helping the team earn a trip to the national tournament for the first time in program history.

Hill and Arieanna have been married for eight years and have five children ranging from 9 months to 14 years old.
