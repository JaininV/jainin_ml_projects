Louis Saha has adjudged Manchester United striker Wout Weghorst “not good enough” for the club.

He said the Dutch player has not done enough to extend his stay at Old Trafford beyond this season.

The Red Devils brought in Weghorst on loan in January to help cover the space created by Cristiano Ronaldo’s exit during the World Cup.

Weghorst has been underwhelming up front, scoring two goals in 21 appearances for the Red Devils.

“It’s not good enough that he’s scored twice in 20 games,” Saha told PaddyPower.

He believed the Netherlands international will not bring any positive impact to the club before his loan spell at the club ends.

“He works hard, but that is not good enough. For me, he hasn’t done enough,” Saha said.
