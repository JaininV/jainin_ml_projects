Breandán Fitzpatrick is, on ‘Sweet Return’, showing another musical face from his main activities – the Irish musician is one half of the band Omonoko who are mostly known for electronic dance music.  However, over a period of a decade he has also been working steadily in the background of the band on his own acoustic singer-songwriter tracks, which are about to take the forefront of his musical ambitions with debut solo single ‘Sweet Return’, which is out on 21st April and here today for an early preview.

Lyrically, the song centres around an individual who no longer is in the world of the protagonist, as Breandán reflects on a difficult relationship, whilst wishing for a ‘Sweet Return’.
