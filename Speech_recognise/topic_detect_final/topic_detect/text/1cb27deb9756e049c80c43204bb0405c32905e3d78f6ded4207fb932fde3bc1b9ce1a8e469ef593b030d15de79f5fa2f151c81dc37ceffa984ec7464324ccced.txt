The settlement is part of the years-long litigation over Facebook’s relationship with Cambridge Analytica, which harvested the personal data of 87 million Facebook users.

The lawsuit was prompted in 2018 after Facebook disclosed that the information of 87 million users was improperly shared with Cambridge Analytica.

People who had an active U. S. Facebook account between May 2007 and December 2022 have until Aug. 25 to enter a claim. Individual settlement payments haven’t yet been established because payouts depend on how many users submit claims and how long each user maintained a Facebook account.

Cambridge Analytica was a British political consultancy used by the presidential campaign of Trump and Ted Cruz and others.

The breach forced Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg to testify before Congress and to take out full-page ads where he apologized for the missteps.

I’m sorry we didn’t do more at the time. We’re now taking steps to ensure this doesn’t happen again,.”

Facebook rebranded itself as Meta in 2021 and settled the class-action suit the following year. a company spokesperson said at the time.

Meta did not admit wrongdoing. We pursued a settlement as it’s in the best interest of our community and shareholders.”

Facebook users have until August to claim their share of a $725 million class-action settlement of a lawsuit alleging privacy violations by the social media company, a new website reveals.

We did the math and if 10 million people put in for the claim, your share would be about $72.50, depending on how long you had an account. (Personally, I had one the entire time so, ka-ching! Dinner at Applebee’s on me!)
