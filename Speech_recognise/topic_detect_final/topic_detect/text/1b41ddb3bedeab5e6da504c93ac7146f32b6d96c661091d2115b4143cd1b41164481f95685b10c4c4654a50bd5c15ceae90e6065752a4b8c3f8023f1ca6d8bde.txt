The Telegraph have revealed that Tottenham Hotspur could now have a clear run at Luis Enrique since the Spaniard is no longer one of the leading candidates for the Chelsea job.

It was reported by The Evening Standard earlier this week that Spurs were set for a face-to-face meeting with Enrique over their managerial vacancy.

The report explained that the former Barcelona boss, who had also spoken to Chelsea recently, is the candidate who is favoured by Fabio Paratici to replace Antonio Conte.

The Telegraph have now claimed that the Blues have started to cut down their shortlist and ‘have not placed’ Enrique among their top candidates to take over from Graham Potter.

The report suggests that the path might now be clear for Tottenham, with the West London club now ‘focused more vividly elsewhere’ with Julian Nagelsmann and former Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino among the contenders at Stamford Bridge.

It is explained that while Daniel Levy had previously expressed reservations over Enrique’s lack of Premier League experience, the 52-year-old has been ‘highly recommended’ to Spurs.

I suspect that Tottenham would lean towards Enrique if Nagelsmann proves out of the reach as the Spaniard has a more proven track record at the highest level than the likes of Arne Slot and Vincent Kompany.

The chances of Spurs appointing Enrique could also depend on whether Paratici is cleared of his charges and resumes his role as the club’s managing director, with his appeal hearing starting this afternoon.
