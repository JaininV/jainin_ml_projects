Glastonbury Festival’s Field of Avalon have revealed their fresh line-up for 2023.

Seeing a return to area favourite Beans On Toast, this year’s Avalon – which takes place at the heart of Worthy Farm – will also feature appearances from the likes of Jake Shears, Melanie C, Mica Paris and Will Young. Lauran Mvula will also make her return to Glastonbury too, as will Gabrielle Aplin and Freya Ridings.

Over the years, the Field of Avalon has become one of the most hotly-contested places at Glastonbury, with revellers fully welcoming of the areas’ diverse lineage of legendary musicians and artists – plus the sublime setting that is the Avalon Inn. Last year’s Glastonbury Festival even saw the entirety of Avalon close off due to the huge turnout for the Sugababes’ debut appearance on the farm.

Check the full line-up below; Glastonbury Festival runs from 21st June 2023.
