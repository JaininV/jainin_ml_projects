People’s Assembly affirmed that Independence Day was, and will remain, an incentive for the Syrian people to triumph over the conspiracies being hatched against them, and that they are the ones who created the evacuation epic and are able to defeat tyrants and greedy people.

“This anniversary has great importance meanings in light of the regional and international changes, especially after the series of great achievements and victories achieved by the men of our Syrian Arab army over the forces of evil, terrorism and aggression to prove to the whole world that the resistance approach remains in our souls” The Assembly said in a statement on the 77th anniversary of the Evacuation Day.

The Assembly added “This approach is translated today on the ground with great sacrifices and standing in the face of unilateral coercive measures, and the unfair economic blockade that aims to harm Syria’s land, people, and institutions”, stressing the confidence in achieving victory under the leadership of President Bashar al-Assad.
