The Flash's Grant Gustin claims he's not zipping through the DC multiverse for Ezra Miller's solo blockbuster this summer.

Directed by It's Andy Muschietti, Worlds of DC movie The Flash features an iconic collision of superheroes, with both Michael Keaton and Ben Affleck's respective Batmen brushing shoulders with the Scarlet Speedster, so you could argue that Gustin's own TV version of Barry Allen would mesh quite well in the madness.

Apparently not, though, as the actor told TVLine: "There's been a lot of rumours out there for a long time and no one's come out directly and asked me, ever, on the record.

"You know, people ask me on the street all the time and, yeah, I'm not keeping some big elaborate secret."

Asked outright whether he was appearing in the movie, Gustin simply replied "no".

If it turns out Gustin is fibbing, this would repay the favour done by Miller back in 2020 when he cameoed in the Arrowverse's Crisis on Infinite Earths event.

At the time, screenwriter Marc Guggenheim said of making that dream a reality: "From the moment we found out that this was a possibility, to once we knew Grant Gustin was cool and on board with it and Ezra was on board with it, I would send drafts of the scene to both Jim Lee and [DC Entertainment's film video president] Adam Schlagman and we would just go back and forth.

"The trick with the scene is that I didn't want to and they didn't want me to do anything that stepped on the toes of the Flashpoint movie that they're developing. So, we really worked hand-in-hand."

The Flash will be released in cinemas on June 16.
