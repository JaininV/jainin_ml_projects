This past Friday marked the start of the first weekend of Coachella 2023 in Indio, California, and the annual music festival certainly delivered in terms of fashion. With a star-studded lineup this year, featuring artists such as Bad Bunny, Blackpink, and Blondie, there was no shortage of bold performance outfits on the Coachella mainstage.

Many celebrities donned their most fashionable ensembles to attend the desert event. However, one aspect of the festival that can only be experienced on-site is the eye-catching fashion of the festivalgoers.

It’s common to see groups of friends dressed in coordinated vibrant patterns or even as characters during the day. Some attendees view the event as an opportunity to showcase their own creations, while others prefer the comfort of T-shirts, tank tops, and shorts.

On stage, iconic rock band Blondie embraced the disco ball aesthetic during their Coachella performance; lead singer Debbie Harry’s cape was adorned with shattered pieces of reflective mirror.

Off stage, Coachella attire incorporated the festival’s signature fashion elements, such as lace, denim, and fringe. Lil Nas X rocked a cropped bomber jacket, a checkered miniskirt by Chopova Lowena, and leather Rick Owens knee boots.

Here is a selection of the most unforgettable outfits from this year’s festival:
