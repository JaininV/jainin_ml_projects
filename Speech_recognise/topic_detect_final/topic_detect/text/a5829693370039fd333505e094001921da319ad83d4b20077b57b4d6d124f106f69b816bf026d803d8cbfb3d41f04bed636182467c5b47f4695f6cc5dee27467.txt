Being famous means that being seen in public with another famous person of the opposite sex almost always leads to dating rumours. Inevitably, this happened when Leonardo DiCaprio and Irina Shayk were seen partying together at Coachella. So, what’s their relationship status?

According to Entertainment Tonight, there’s nothing to see here. “Leo and Irina are not dating,” a source told the outlet. “They are just friends and have known each other for a long time through mutual friends. They were with a big group of people at Neon Carnival and there were not any romantic vibes between them.”

Rumors swirled after DiCaprio, Shayk, and a third person were photographed close together during Saturday’s Neon Carnival. Both DiCaprio and Shayk also attended a Revolve event the next day, but an eyewitness told ET, “They hung out in separate cabanas and not with each other. Irina was with her publicist and friends and Leo was with friends and some girls. Both of them had a great time doing their own thing.”

DiCaprio is friends with Bradley Cooper, Shayk’s ex with whom she shares six-year-old daughter Lea. The two have a friendly co-parenting relationship, having been seen publicly hanging out, celebrating holidays, and going on vacation together since their 2019 split.

Shayk previously talked to ELLE about her post-breakup dynamic with Cooper. “I never understood the term co-parenting,” she said. “When I’m with my daughter, I’m 100 percent a mother, and when she’s with her dad, he’s 100 percent her dad. Co-parenting is parenting.”

Meanwhile, DiCaprio was most recently linked to Camila Morrone, who he dated for six years before the couple ended their relationship in August 2022.
