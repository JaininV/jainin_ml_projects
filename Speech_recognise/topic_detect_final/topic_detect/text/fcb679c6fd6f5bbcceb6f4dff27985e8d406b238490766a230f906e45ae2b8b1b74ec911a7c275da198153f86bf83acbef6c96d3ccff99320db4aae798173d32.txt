There are of course serial offenders out there; from infamous names who are familiar to police forces around the world, to suspects who find themselves behind bars several times throughout their lifetimes. But one young man from Den Bosch has taken the term “serial offender” to the next level and now faces jail time after police officers arrested him for driving without a valid licence for the 15th time.

This time around, the 22-year-old - whose identity remains unknown - was stopped by police on the motorway near Zwolle. According to the Eindhovens Dagblad, the car was pulled over near an exit on the A28, and police report that, in the time it took them to reach the car, it appeared as though the driver and passenger had quickly swapped places.

“The initial driver was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of drugs, but refused the saliva and blood tests,” police told the press.

Upon reaching the local police station officers realised the driver had given false information and that he wasn’t in possession of a driving licence. Police records then revealed that this was in fact the 15th time the 22-year-old had been discovered behind the wheel of a vehicle, even though he was not legally allowed to drive.

If it weren't so dangerous, it would almost be impressive. But 15 times was clearly one time too many as far as the authorities are concerned: as punishment for his crimes, the Dutch Public Prosecution Service (OM) says the man faces a jail sentence for each of his 14 repeat offences.
