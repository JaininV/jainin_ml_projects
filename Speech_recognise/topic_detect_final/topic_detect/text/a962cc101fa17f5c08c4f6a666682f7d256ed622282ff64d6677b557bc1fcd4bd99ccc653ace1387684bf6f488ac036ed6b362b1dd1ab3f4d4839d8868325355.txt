SAINT International's highly anticipated Fashion Face of the Caribbean and Avant Garde Designer of the Year competitions return to the social calendar this Sunday, April 23, at the AC Hotel in Kingston.

Eighty-five female and male model hopefuls will debut to a panel of international agents, with fingers crossed, hoping to land lucrative contracts with top agencies in the fashion capitals of Paris, New York, Milan and London.

"Excitement is fever pitch right now among the industry insiders who fly in this weekend,"  SAINT's CEO Deiwght Peters said.

"We have an exceptionally strong set of faces and it's going to be an unenviable task to choose from these stunning young Jamaicans," he added.

Peters said that his agency's hard-working team combed model talent from the island's three counties of Cornwall, Middlesex and Surrey as well as model prospects scouted from the United States and other Caribbean countries.

In the meantime, 15 Jamaican fashion innovators will be vying for the title of Avant Garde Designer and a $60,000 token prize award from the Ministry of Culture and Entertainment at Sunday's event. The gifted menswear and womenswear designer contestants will showcase their stylish twists to create distinct pieces channelling a 'Jamaica 60' theme.

"Based on the preliminary looks already previewed and sketches the designers revealed to me, it's going to be next-level cutting-edge fashion drama as they attempt to use their designs and take on the requested challenge of telling the story of our culture and be influenced by our motto, 'Out of Many One People'," the SAINT CEO said.

Meanwhile, an exciting entertainment package has been lined up for Sunday's event, with dancehall diva D'Angel set to headline a concert to cap off the event. The show will also feature Spanish reggae singer Irie Souljah and fast-rising reggae songstress Yeza.
