Stefanos Tsitsipas is confident of winning his first Grand Slam title soon and believes he is on the right path towards attaining the goal.

The World No. 5 reached the final of the 2021 French Open and the 2023 Australian Open. However, he was thwarted by Novak Djokovic on both occasions.

Speaking to Punto de Break, Tsitsipas stated that he is "really close" to achieving Grand Slam glory and just needs to "continue fighting" to reach another Major final.

To win a maiden Grand Slam title, however, Tsitsipas knows he'll have to "level up" and improve his preparation.

After a quarter-final exit from the Monte-Carlo Masters, the Greek is hopeful of going further at this week's Barcelona Open, which he called "one of the biggest challenges on the circuit."

Stefanos Tsitsipas will commence his campaign in Barcelona on Wednesday (April 19). His Round of 32 opponent is yet to be decided.

In the same interview, Stefanos Tsitsipas admitted that World No. 2 Carlos Alcaraz presents a huge threat to his Grand Slam chances. Nevertheless, he is up for the challenge.

With Rafael Nadal still struggling with injury, the 2023 French Open might well offer a great opportunity for Tsitsipas to finally break his Grand Slam duck.
