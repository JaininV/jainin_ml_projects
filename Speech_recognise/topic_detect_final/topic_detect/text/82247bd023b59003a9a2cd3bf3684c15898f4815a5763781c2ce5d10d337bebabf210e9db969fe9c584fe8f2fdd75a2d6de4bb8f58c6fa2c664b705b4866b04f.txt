The new support hero, Lifeweaver, launched in a lackluster state in Overwatch 2. Players were underwhelmed by the hero’s controls, forcing many to completely remap controls to better optimize the hero, thereby warranting developmental fixes.

In response to the community’s feedback, Overwatch 2 developer Aaron Keller publicized their intended changes for Lifeweaver. This update aims to correct many of the issues which currently plague the new support hero’s controls.

Though the update is not yet live, Aaron Keller posted the news detailing the changes on Twitter.

“Lifeweaver controls update next week!” he stated, before revealing the specific quality of life changes targeting the hero’s controls.

“This will become the new default, with options to use the old style. Details on coming balance changes for Lifeweaver will be posted later this week by our lead hero designer,” he stated in summation.

In other words, these aren’t the only changes foreseen on the horizon. Expect number balancing in the near future. And in all likelihood, Alec Dawson, the Lead Hero Designer for Overwatch 2 will be publicizing the information.

According to Dawson, “Balance changes are still being considered,” and they will have more info by the end of the week.
