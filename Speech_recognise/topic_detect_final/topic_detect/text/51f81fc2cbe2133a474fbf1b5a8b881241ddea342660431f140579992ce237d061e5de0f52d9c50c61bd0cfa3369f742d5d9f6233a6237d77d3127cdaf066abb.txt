Singers Sheryl Crow and Amy Grant teamed up to lobby Tennessee lawmakers for more gun control on Tuesday. NewsChannel5 reported Crow saying, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre just here to give voice what a lot of, not only artists, musical artists, but also moms, dads, [want].‚Äù

Grant said, ‚ÄúNashville is in a unique position to do this work.‚Äù

Rolling Stone reported that Crow and Grant are joined by Kacey Musgraves and Jason Isbell. The four artists are part of a new gun control group called Voices for a Safer Tennessee.

They need to make sure none of their crews have even one firearm.

And she says she‚Äôs a Christian. A lukewarm one!

They had gun control in Germany, Soviet Union, China, Cambodia, Laos. But the government killed over 150 million of their own citizens. What do these entertainers think about being at the front of the line?

Those two would have to team up to have an idea. Not an original one, but a cheap copy of one of the weakest ideas that came from the weakest area of the population (NEA woke eddikators).

Sheryl

So you don‚Äôt want your sons to be able to defend

themselves? or you?

Not everybody is Bruce Lee.

I guarntee you Bruce Lee is not as fast as a 12 yr old with a Makarov.

Y‚Äôall can‚Äôt stop drugs, what makes you think you will stop

guns and ammo?

I‚Äôm tired of this stupid argument...we have 10,000 local and state laws, 460 pages of ATF laws, dozens and dozens of Federal laws. These dunces should be talking about Trans-nut movement instead.

Crow is hopeless idiot. This is not the first time she has demonstrated it.

How about Gun Control in Pleasanton, CA?
