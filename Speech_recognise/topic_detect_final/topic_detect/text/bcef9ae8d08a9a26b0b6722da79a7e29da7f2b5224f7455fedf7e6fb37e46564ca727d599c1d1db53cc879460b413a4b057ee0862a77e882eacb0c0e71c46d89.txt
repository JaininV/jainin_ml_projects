I’ve had plenty of obsessions.  As a teenager, it was the rock group Queen; then it was Formula One; at the moment it’s Blue Heelers.  As a Christian, I think it’s ok to have these things we enjoy, as long as we can keep them in proper perspective.

I stopped watching Formula One for a while because I grew to love it too much.  At church when I relied on someone else for transport, I would feel myself getting irritated when people chattered at the end and all I wanted to do was get home in time for the start of the race.  That told me my priorities were a bit skewed.

I can fall into a similar trap nowadays.  Sometimes it feels easier to escape to Mount Thomas (the fictional town where Blue Heelers is set) than it does to pray, because praying means owning my worries and giving them to God.

There can be a very fine line between enjoyment and idolatry.  I need to remember the ways in which God is superior.  Blue Heelers might be comforting in a general sense, but God knows my specific needs and He can meet them.  My love and devotion belong to God, first and foremost.  He must be my prime obsession.  Matthew 6:33:  “But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well”.
