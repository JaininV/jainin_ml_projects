According to new research, a fifth of adults wrongly believe Alzheimer’s and dementia are the same thing.

17% mistakenly believe that if a family member develops dementia, they will too, while  14% per cent think those living with the condition can’t lead a meaningful life.

The research was commissioned by nationwide care home provider and dementia experts Care UK, which are aiming to debunk these myths and provide vital support to families whose loved ones have been diagnosed with the condition thanks to a new video guide, ‘One step at a time – A video guide to navigating dementia’.‘Dementia’ is an umbrella term used for a number of conditions – rather than a specific one – that share common symptoms including remembering, thinking, decision making which often disrupt everyday activities. In reality, dementia is a condition that can be managed to ensure those who live with it can continue to lead fulfilling, meaningful lives and can be supported to still do the things they love. That said, just over a third (34%) admit they don’t know very much about the condition or have much experience with it.
