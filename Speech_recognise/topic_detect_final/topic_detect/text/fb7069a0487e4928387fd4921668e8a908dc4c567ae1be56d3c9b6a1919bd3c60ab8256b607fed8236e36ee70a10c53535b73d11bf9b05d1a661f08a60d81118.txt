In Greensboro, North Carolina, golf can be a year-round sport*. There is, however, seasonality given it is an outdoor sport and the weather must be conducive to playing a round. It can't be too wet, or the turf and greens can get damaged. It can't be cold or golfers have trouble with their swing. There are times of the year when certain courses are dormant because they need to be repaired. In Greensboro, the answer to when golf can be played is, "it depends." For sure, yesterday was a nice day for playing golf it was sunny but not too hot.

The above photo was taken at the The Farm Course of the Greensboro Country Club. We love to walk on all of those roads off Carlson Dairy. They are very walkable and it is fun to see golfers in the distance playing golf. Greensboro and Guilford County have golf options at all price points and public as well as private. Courses really look nice this time of year, before it starts getting too hot. Hope to see you out there playing.
