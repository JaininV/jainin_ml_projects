If that is the case, the Bengals, who have been named a top trade destination for Baker, should at least consider it. Cincinnati is in win-now mode and if the team can add the 27-year-old to its roster without giving up a first-round pick, it seems like a steal.

The Bengals signedÂ safety Nick Scott this offseason to play alongside second-year safety Daxton Hill, but Baker would certainly be an upgrade over either player.

The five-time Pro Bowler has 650 tackles, 7.5 sacks, six forced fumbles and seven interceptions in his career.

Things could get a little tricky as Baker wants a new contract and Cincinnati is planning to soon pay QB Joe Burrow as well. But with nothing imminent and just under $17M still in cap space, why not go all in while Burrow is still cheap?
