Yellow dust originating from mainland China was observed across wide swaths of northern Kyushu as of 10 a.m. on April 12, reducing visibility to as low as under 10 kilometers in some areas, according to the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA).

The seasonal sand is forecast to reach broad areas in the Tokai and Kanto-Koshin regions from central to east Japan later on April 12. As the dust is expected to reach northern Japan, the agency is calling for people to be wary of potential traffic disruptions.

According to the agency, yellow dust was observed in northern and northeastern China on the morning of April 11. Normally, the dust -- emanating from the Gobi Desert and other dry regions in East Asia -- is often observed in spring in Japan, obscuring landscapes and soiling the surface of cars and laundry.

In China, it has been reported that visibility was reduced to as low as under 2 kilometers in some areas. Japan is also projected to experience reduced visibility under 10 km, and even less than 5 km in some areas.

In the Tokai and Kanto-Koshin regions, a cold front was expected to pass on the afternoon of April 12, halting precipitation, to be followed by the arrival of yellow dust through April 13, according to the weather agency. Visibility may be reduced to as low as under 5 km in some areas.

The dust was also expected to reach the Chugoku region on April 12, the regions of Shikoku, Kinki, Hokuriku, Tohoku and Hokkaido from April 12 through 13, and the Tokai and Kanto-Koshin regions from the afternoon of April 12 through the next day.

The JMA's Fukuoka Regional Headquarters is calling on people to be wary of laundry hanging outside getting covered with yellow dust, as well as potential traffic disruptions when driving under reduced visibility.
