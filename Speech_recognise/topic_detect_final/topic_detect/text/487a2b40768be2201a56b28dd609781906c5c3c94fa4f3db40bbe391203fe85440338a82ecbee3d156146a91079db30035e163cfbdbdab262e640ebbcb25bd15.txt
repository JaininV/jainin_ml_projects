The ACC parted ways with senior associate commissioner for women’s basketball, Mary McElroy, earlier this month, multiple sources confirmed to The Athletic on Sunday. The move happened following an ongoing conference office evaluation, per a league source.

McElroy was hired by the ACC in 2019 and oversaw all things ACC women’s hoops — working with the programs and coaches, television scheduling, the tournament, reffing and more. During her nearly four-year tenure, ACC teams advanced to the Elite Eight six times, more than any other conference in the country. This season, three different ACC teams — Virginia Tech, Louisville and Miami — all made the Elite Eight, with Virginia Tech advancing to the Final Four.

Prior to her position with the ACC, McElroy was the executive senior associate athletic director and senior woman administrator (SWA) at Temple. She also worked as a senior executive in athletics administration at Georgia Tech and Georgia State.
