A hearing that was scheduled for tomorrow in U. S. District Court in Portland, Oregon, to determine the amount of restitution owed by disgraced attorney Lori Deveny, has been cancelled, according to documents filed today. The government’s restitution memorandum stated that the parties “have agreed to the amount of restitution defendant owes the victims in this case.”

That amount is $4,013,385.07, payable to Deveny’s many client victims, the Oregon State Bar, Wells Fargo Bank, and the I. R.S.

Deveny owes over $2 million to her former clients, whose names are filed under seal — although that information was released to me by court order in the state’s criminal case. Deveny was sentenced to 111 months, which she will serve in a federal prison in Florida. The rest of her 14-year sentence will be served in an Oregon state prison.
