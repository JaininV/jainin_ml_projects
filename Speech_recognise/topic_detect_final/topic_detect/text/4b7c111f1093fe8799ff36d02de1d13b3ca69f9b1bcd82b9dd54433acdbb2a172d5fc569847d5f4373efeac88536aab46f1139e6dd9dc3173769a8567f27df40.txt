Festus Keyamo, a spokesman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Presidential Campaign, has slammed supporters of the Labour Party Presidential candidate, Peter Obi, popularly known as Obidients for their inability to take criticisms.

Keyamo, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria and minister of state for Labour spoke against the ongoing criticisms of Nobel Laureate, Professor Wole Soyinka by Obidients.

The Minister, in a post on his social media lamented that while the Obidients threw all sorts of trash at other candidates, including those of APC, during the campaigns.

He said while APC and others took the campaign with equanimity and responded to all such jabs, the Obidients have been thrown into tails first with the audio of conversation of Peter Obi with Bishop David Oyedepo of Living Faith Church. He noted that situation of the Obidients have been worsened by recent criticisms of the methods.

Describing the Obidients as mentally weak for their inability to take criticisms, Keyamo said in Twitter post: “It is evident that the so-called Obidients are MENTALLY WEAK. They threw all sorts of trash at other candidates, including ours, during the campaigns and we took it with equanimity and responded to all such jabs.

“They made memes, skits and caricatured the images of opponents and had fun until the reality check of Feb. 25th. But now that the heat has turned on them and their ‘hero’ in the last few days or weeks, they have obviously cracked with many loosing their heads. Just one audio sent them into a pitiful tailspin with close aides confirming and denying the audio all at the same time like a ragtag army.

“And with the avalanche of criticisms from unlikely quarters in the last few days, they have completely lost it. They are cursing and swearing at every perceived enemy and are beginning to sound forlorn. It is evidence of a weak mentality. But I have good news for them: it is time for the reasonable ones who are patriots amongst them to quickly exit that ignoble bubble and join hands with the in-coming administration to move this country forward. Anything short of that would be tantamount to continuously ‘living in bondage!’ 😁”
