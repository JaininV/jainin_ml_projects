It comes as rates of assault double since the past five years and videos from across the U. S. of educators and school staff being harassed emerge

This is the horrifying moment a 15-year-old high school student punched a teacher in the head while demanding to get his cell phone.

Footage circulating Twitter shows the student standing intimidatingly close to the shorter educator repeatedly asking for his 'f*****g phone' before swinging his fist into the teacher's face.

Lamar High School in Houston sent a letter to families with principal Rita Graves saying that this type of behavior won't be tolerated and that administrators were looking at ways to prevent this happening again.

Neither student or teacher have been publicly identified at this time.

In the clip a student repeatedly says 'give me my f*****g phone back' the teacher calmly asking the student to 'sit down.'

'Give me my phone,' the student his heard saying yet again and appearing exasperated.

The student is then seen leaning back and punching the teacher square in the face as a bystander who is out of frame screams in disbelief.

The person filming is seen quickly ending the recording as the savage attack takes place.

DailyMail.com has contacted students, parents and Lamar High School's principal Graves for comment.

Speaking to KHOU 11 Texas branch of the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), the second largest teacher's labor union in America, said the kid has made a 'huge mistake.'

'Unfortunately, this kid's made a huge mistake,' AFT Texas president Zeph Capo said.

Capo called on HISD to properly punish the student and added that he will support the move to keep the student off campus.

'By all means, he should not be allowed back on a regular campus,' Capo said. 'This is not something that needs to be tolerated.'

Capo and other educators don't believe there could have been anything that warranted that kind of reaction, much less the teacher confiscating a phone which is allowed under certain circumstances in HISD schools.

'Unfortunately, we see too much of this,' Capo said. 'We see too much of this happening toward our teachers and toward our school employees.'

According to the outlet, 520 incidents were recorded in the 2021- 2022 school year double from that in the five previous years.

There have been nearly 1,200 assaults from 2017 - 202, according to TEA discipline reports obtained by the publication.

'I've certainly experienced angry reactions,' Capo said. 'I've certainly experienced students throwing desks across the room.'

Capo said he's never been struck by a student even while working in an alternative school. He commended the Lamar teacher for not fighting back.

'Which is all the more reason I hope that this teacher is supported, that the principal does what they need to do, that the school district follows the law,' Capo said.

Filming disrespectful behavior toward school staff has become a common phenomenon with the moment an upset teacher quit her job going viral just last month.

The distressing TikTok footage captured the moment an upset teacher quit her job and marched out of a classroom while saying: 'I'm just a stupid old white lady.'

The woman, who has not been identified, looked distressed as she started to pack up her belongings before storming out of the classroom.

Initially pupils can be heard laughing, before a male voice says 'woah isn't no way' as she continues out the door.

It remains unclear which school or even where in the US the incident took place, with text over the top of the footage saying 'they made the teacher leave.'

Just this week, an Ohio school bus driver was also seen resigning in despair after screaming at students who sprayed perfume on her bus in the hopes of making her have an asthma attack.

Jackie Miller was filmed telling the alleged teenage bullies to 'shut your mouth' in the town of Amherst where she'd worked for the past two years, before finally declaring 'I'm done with this s**t!'

The driver of 15 years quit after last week's incident, throwing up her hands on what she told local outlets was incessantly bad behavior from a specific group of students on her line, who she claims bullied her out of a job.

As the video racked up millions of views, Miller became an unlikely hero as scores of people leapt to her defense over what they felt was a fair reaction to a dangerous situation.

A GoFundMe page was launched to support her, and a local store even started selling t-shirts with her infamous exasperated declaration printed on it, donating the proceeds to school bus driver associations.

Though Miller later told 3News that she regretted the incident, she said that she would not take it back and that she felt her behavior was justified.

In the video, Miller could be seen storming down the aisle of her bus after a student told her that somebody had sprayed perfume.

'How much more do you expect me to f*****g take?' she yelled, then demanded to know which student had done it.

All the students denied spraying anything, but Miller insisted she could 'freaking smell it.'

'I'm sick of you, I'm done with it,' she said, pointing out individual students. 'I'm gonna start f*****g kicking some serious a**.

'Do you hear me?' she yelled. 'My foot's gonna be so far up your a** it's gonna dangle out your f*****g nose.'

As the kids kept denying they'd sprayed perfume, Miller insisted she could smell it, saying: 'I'm allergic to that s**t.

'I ought to walk off this bus right now and let you people walk the f**k home,' she said.

Despite the severity of her reaction, Miller later defended her actions, telling 3News how just a month prior the same group of students had intentionally sprayed perfume on the bus and caused her to have a serious asthma attack.

'She sprayed perfume on the bus and I had a horrible asthma attack,' she said.

'I had to stop the bus, grab my inhaler and try to get my lungs to open up again. I had all the kids open up all the windows they know this.'

Miller explained that those students had been intentionally provoking her for years and that when the perfume was sprayed again after the first incident she'd finally had enough.

'I'm sorry for the way this went down, I truly am,' she said. 'I do apologize for my actions, but I won't take it back.

'This is a plight of all bus drivers, we are treated in the worst possible sense of the word,' she added. 'We are treated with such lack of respect.'

The Amherst schools superintendent told 3News that students had been disciplined following the incident.

The owner of the local clothing store Main Street Threads, Jacqui Adkins, said she felt for Miller after seeing the video and decided to make t-shirts to support her.

'We all kind of just felt for her in that moment. We've all had bad days, we've all gone through hardships and our hearts just went out for her,' she said.
