I live in White Rock, but prefer to come all the way to Garry Point because of the accessibility, price and quality of Pajo’s in the park.

It’s too difficult to access the wharf location because of parking, no washrooms, steep inclined access and limited space on the float.

Garry Point has parking, washrooms, space and is easy for walkers, bikes and dog owners.

When the city gives the excuse that the decision isn’t about money, it doesn’t make sense.

Pajo’s is an institution and destination for many throughout the Lower Mainland.

I speak for many that will absolutely boycott the new and unfair replacement business.

Whoever suggested this idea forward must have their own agenda. Why didn’t you do a survey before making this unpopular decision? Something doesn’t smell right here.

You will definitely be losing many visitors who came to Steveston specifically to visit this business.
