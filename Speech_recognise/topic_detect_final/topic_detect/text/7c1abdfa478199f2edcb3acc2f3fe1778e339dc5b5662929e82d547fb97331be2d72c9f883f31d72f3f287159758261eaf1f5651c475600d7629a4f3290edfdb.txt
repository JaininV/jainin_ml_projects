I don't know man. Filing an appeal now so that's my main focus

It’s been a rough couple of days for Chris Curtis.

The middleweight “Action Man” wound up on the wrong end of a unanimous decision in his “Fight of the Night” war against longtime veteran Kelvin Gastelum as part of the UFC 287 card last weekend in Miami.

“I thought I won, the numbers back it,” Curtis wrote after the bout. “Tough fight and good for KG, but that headbutt cost me the fight on optics. Even with it happening, I still managed to tie the round on strikes. That sucks... that really fucking sucks.”

Losing can be a tough pill to swallow, so it’s understandable why Curtis was upset.

Then came the official UFC rankings update (see it here) and Gastelum was promoted four places to No. 11. As a result, Curtis lost his position and now clings to the No. 15 spot. That didn't sit well with “Action Man,” who is lashing out on Twitter.

“He gets moved to Rank 11 for that bullshit when I for sure wouldn’t have just proves it’s about the story of Kelvin is back,” Curtis wrote. “What a fucking joke. ... I would have gained a spot at best.”

MMA fans decided to weigh in and things went off the rails fairly quickly.

“Action Man” revealed he’s “filing an appeal” to contest the outcome.

Curtis, 35, first appeared on Dana White’s “Contender Series” back in June 2018 and would eventually make his Octagon debut with a knockout win over Phil Hawes at UFC 268. The loss to Gastelum dropped Curtis (30-10) to 4-2 under the UFC banner but the Ohioan already has three performance bonuses to to his credit.
