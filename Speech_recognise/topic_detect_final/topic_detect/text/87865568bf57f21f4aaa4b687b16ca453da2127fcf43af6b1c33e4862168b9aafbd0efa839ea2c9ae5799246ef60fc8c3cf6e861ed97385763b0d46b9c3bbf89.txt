Featured on AutoHunter, the online auction platform driven by ClassicCars.com, is this 1958 Chevrolet Impala Sport Coupe. This Impala is powered by the new-for-1958 348ci big-block mated to a 700R4 four-speed automatic transmission. Equipment includes dual antennas, power steering and brakes, and whitewall tires. Finished in black over a tri-tone vinyl and cloth interior, this first-year Impala comes with a clear title.

The reportedly rust-free body has been refinished in the original monotone color of Onyx Black (code 900A).

Steel 14-inch wheels with wheel covers and knock-off-style center caps are wrapped in whitewall tires.

The cabin is furnished with black vinyl seats upholstered with turquoise/black/gray cloth inserts (code 806). The seats are complemented by matching door panels and turquoise dashboard. Other features include a push-button AM radio and clock.

Instrumentation consists of a 120-mph speedometer and auxiliary gauges for the fuel level and coolant temperature.

The 348ci Turbo-Thrust V8 is fed by a four-barrel carburetor and directs power to the rear wheels via a column-shifted 700R4 four-speed automatic transmission. The engine breathes through a dual-exhaust system.
