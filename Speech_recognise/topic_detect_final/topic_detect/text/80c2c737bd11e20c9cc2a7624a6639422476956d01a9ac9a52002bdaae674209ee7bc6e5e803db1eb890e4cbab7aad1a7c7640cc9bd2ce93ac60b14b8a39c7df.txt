The guests alighted on the premises of ‘The Kutchh Courtyard’ in the middle of summer, the whiff of Jasmine and Frangipani flowers blended with the chorus of chirping birds. The delightful sight of the boutique homestay carried a distinct character.

Bird baths, furniture in the gazebo and the plethora of handicraft skills unravelled, inviting the guests to immerse in the spirit of warm hospitality and the profuse creativity of Kutch.

The door with a stunning door décor manifesting the power of the Sun’s energy in wood, a collage panel of the blocks of the royal Ajrakh prints, and tasteful antiques engulfed the guests.

It was on the outer side an amalgamation of the architecture of Kerala, Portuguese, but the décor breathed the essence of Kutch.

Away from the chaos of the city of Bhuj and yet nearby, ‘The Kutchh Courtyard’ illustrates sensitivity towards the environment and extends extraordinary efforts to support several creative communities. These communities are the repositories of the rich intangible heritage of the Rann of Kutch. The homestay is located in the crafts village of Bhujodi. It is close to The Living and Learning Design Centre (LLDC), which is committed to revitalising and conserving the intangible heritage of Kutch.

The comfortable rooms and impeccable cleanliness of the property are part of the experience.  The guests rejoiced in the warm hospitality and care of the owners, Smita and Abhinav. The details overviewed by the owners regarding each guest and the fantastic, delicious and varied home food and cuisine were all about getting a home away from home!

As Cultural Heritage Expert, it was truly an experience that helped the visitor to balance the intensity of the energies of Kutch with the calmness, warmth and peaceful environment of an authentic experience.
