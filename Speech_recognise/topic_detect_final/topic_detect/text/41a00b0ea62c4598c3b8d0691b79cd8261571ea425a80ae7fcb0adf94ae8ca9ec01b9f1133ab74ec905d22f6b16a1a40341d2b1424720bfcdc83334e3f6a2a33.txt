The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) has sent a legal notice to Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) state president K Annamalai asking him to take down all material related to ‘DMK Files’ and apologise or else he would be sued for defamation of the party as well as its president, Chief Minister MK Stalin.

The amount sought in damages is Rs 500 crore. The legal notice was issued by Senior Advocate and Rajya Sabha member from the DMK, P Wilson.

After the release of the ‘DMK Files’ and the details of the Rafale watch, while Excise and Electricity Minister V Senthil Balaji had said that the bill provided by Annamalai for the watch did not seem genuine, Rajya Sabha member and DMK Organising Secretary RS Bharathi said that the concerned ministers would respond.

Kanimozhi, the daughter of Chief Minister MK Stalin, said that Annamalai was resorting to this in order to maintain his relevance in state politics.
