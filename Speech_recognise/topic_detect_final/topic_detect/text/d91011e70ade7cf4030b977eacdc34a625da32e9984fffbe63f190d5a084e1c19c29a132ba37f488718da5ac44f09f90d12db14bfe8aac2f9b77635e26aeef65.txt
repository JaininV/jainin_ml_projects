CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. (WDEF) — The Chattanooga Fire Department (CFD) said Tuesday morning has been very busy, and that they responded to a fire on Rossville Boulevard.

Firefighters found a fire at 2817 Rossville Boulevard shortly after 9:30 a.m. on Tuesday. It’s at the intersection with Doyle Street.

They said fire and smoke was coming out of a boarded-up commercial building.

The CFD said they put out the fire within a few minutes.

Chris Cordes is a Captain for the Chattanooga Fire Department. He said, “Arson investigator did come out to the scene, since there was no power or gas hooked up to this structure. Incidentally, I have been told by other officers that this is about the third time the structure has caught on fire. In the past though, when it caught on fire, it was occupied by a company. It’s the first time it’s caught on fire since it was vacant.”

Captain Cordes also said that it is possible that homeless people were living inside the structure, but that is not certain.

News 12 witnessed a lot of trash inside the building while on the scene.

Officials are investigating the fire. They also said no one was injured.
