Awww! Thoughts and prayers to the right wing hate speech platform, Parler (emphasis mine):

The right-wing social media site Parler on Friday is now under new ownership and has temporarily shuttered amid what it described as a “strategic reassessment” of the business, the company said in a statement.

Parler was purchased by Starboard, a Virginia-based firm, which in a statement posted on the shuttered website signaled it will widen its reach beyond its right-wing audience.

Starboard described Parler as “the world’s pioneering ‘uncancelable’ free speech platform” but acknowledged that “No reasonable person believes that a Twitter clone just for conservatives is a viable business any more.”
