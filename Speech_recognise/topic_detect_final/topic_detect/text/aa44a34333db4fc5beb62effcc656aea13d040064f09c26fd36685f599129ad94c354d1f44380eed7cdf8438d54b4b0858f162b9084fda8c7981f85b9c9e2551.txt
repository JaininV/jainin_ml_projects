Israeli media cited estimates in the Israeli occupation security and military establishment that the next escalation in the Gaza Strip will lead to an escalation in the north of occupied Palestine.

On its Telegram channel, “Israel” News said  Hamas has accumulated sufficient strength in the north in order to fire dozens of rockets from Lebanon toward occupied Al-Jalil, as well as hundreds of rockets from Gaza toward the south and the center of occupied Palestine.

The estimates come amid an ongoing state of great Israeli fear of the inability to confront any large-scale military escalation, which may force “Israel” to fight on several fronts at the same time.

Last week, on the eve of the International Al-Quds Day commemoration, Israeli media reported the occupation’s fear and frustration with the events that might happen, confirming that the Israeli occupation deployed Iron Dome batteries in various illegal Israeli settlements, in light of the ongoing tensions all over occupied Palestine and the region, especially due to the recent rocket fire launched from Lebanon, Syria, and Gaza.

The pressure on Benjamin Netanyahu’s government and the Israeli occupation security and military establishments increased after the intensification of Palestinian Resistance operations against the occupation in occupied Al-Quds, the West Bank, and the ’48 occupied territories.
