The Third Secret of Fatima and(...)  The Third Secret of Fatima and The War for Ukraine.   Father Malachi Martin was privy to the Third Prophecy of Fatima. He was a translator for the Pope at the time it was given. The Pope refused to share the secret with the world and Father Martin was told to take a vow not to reveal it. However, he did hint at it numerous times. In 1996 he said it involved Russia, Ukraine and Kiev and the events foretold would happen twenty years in the future. That would place the war as beginning in 2016, the very year the troubles began.

The three secrets of Fatima were revealed to the three children; Lucia, Jacinta and Francisco, in 1917. Lucia revealed two of them in 1941. Lucia did not want to reveal the third but was ordered to by a bishop in 1943. It was sealed in a letter not to be opened until 1960. Father Malachi Martin was present when this letter was opened and read.
