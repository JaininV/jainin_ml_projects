LEWISTON — Katherine Gagnon, a registered nurse in oncology at Central Maine Medical Center, has been presented with the DAISY Award, an international recognition program.

Gagnon was nominated by the wife of a cancer patient. A second nomination came from a patient being cared for at CMMC. The patient described how Katherine advocated for her, looked out for her emotional and physical well-being, and involved her family in decisions every step of the way.

The DAISY Award was created to give patients and their families a way to express their gratitude to nurses who provide exceptional care.

“It’s wonderful to see Katherine receive this well-deserved recognition,” Kris Chaisson, chief nursing officer for Central Maine Healthcare, said.
