Why are CGI project managers essential for both clients and artists of a 3D visualization company? PMs are responsible for all kinds of non-creative yet crucial tasks. These include completing briefs with clients, managing deadlines, distributing tasks among team members, and so on. If 3D artists were in charge of all that, it would take clients ages to get their renders. But fortunately, there are PMs who take care of all the management aspects. This way, they let 3D artists focus on creating photoreal masterpieces and help clients get the perfect results — always on time.

So, how exactly do ArchiCGI’s project managers help streamline work processes for both clients and artists? To discuss that, we’ve invited our Senior project manager Christina Kostanets for an interview.

Chris has unveiled all the ins and outs of a PM’s work in our 3D rendering company. She also shared tips on how to create a perfect brief, what to do if you don’t have one at all, how to have a project completed successfully within a limited budget or tight deadline, and much more. Let’s dive into this treasure trove of knowledge right away!
