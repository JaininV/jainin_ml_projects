According to the weather department, dangerously high temperatures have been reported in West Bengal, Bihar and Andhra Pradesh, as well as parts of four other states -

Sikkim, Jharkhand, Odisha and Uttar Pradesh -

as what might be a

challenging summer begins to take hold across the country.

According to the IMD, Punjab and Haryana are likely to experience heatwave conditions on Tuesday. A

weather department alert was issued following the death of at least 13 people due to sunstroke after attending the Maharashtra Bhushan award ceremony, as reports cite.

A

heatwave

is an extended period of abnormally hot weather. It usually occurs during the summer months and can cause heat-related illnesses and fatalities. Heatwaves can also cause an increase in air pollution and energy demand due to increased air conditioning use

[1].

A heat wave is declared when the maximum temperature of a

station reaches at least 40 degrees Celsius in the plains, at least 37 degrees Celsius in coastal areas, and at least 30 degrees Celsius in hilly regions, and the departure from normal is at least 4.5 degrees.

A moderate temperature is tolerable for most people, but modest health concerns exist for vulnerable groups, such as infants, the elderly, and those suffering from chronic diseases

[2].

During hot weather, it is advisable to wear clothes that are lightweight, light-coloured, loose, and made of cotton. You should also cover your head with a

cloth, hat, or umbrella.

There is an increased likelihood of heat illness symptoms in people who have been exposed to sunlight for a

prolonged period of time or are doing heavy work. This is a

significant health concern for people who are vulnerable to heat illness.

For example,

infants, the elderly, and people with chronic diseases

[3].

Stay hydrated by drinking adequate amounts of water -

even if you are not thirsty. Use ORS, as well as homemade beverages such as lassi, torani (rice water), lemon water, buttermilk, etc.

With summertime in full swing, heat waves are becoming increasingly common. With temperatures soaring, it's important to take extra precautions to stay safe in the heat

[4][5].

1. Make sure to drink plenty of fluids, regardless of your activity level. Avoid drinks with alcohol or caffeine.

2. Wear loose, light-coloured clothing. Darker colours absorb more sunlight, so make sure to opt for lighter shades to keep cool.

3.

Avoid

going

outdoors

during the hottest hours of the day. If you must be outside, take frequent breaks in a

cool, air-conditioned space.

When the temperature outside is high, avoid vigorous activities. It is advisable not to work outside between 12 noon and 3

p.m.

4. Eat light meals. Heavy meals require your body to work harder to digest, making you feel warmer.

6. Spend time in air-conditioned spaces. If you can't find an air-conditioned space, find a

shady spot or a

fan to help keep cool.

7. Do not leave children or pets in parked vehicles.

8. Keep animals in the shade and give them plenty of water to drink.

10. Make frequent use of fans, damp clothing, and cold water baths.

11. Check on elderly family members and neighbours. Older adults are at a

higher risk of heat-related health issues, so make sure to check in on them during a

heatwave.
