After facing heavy backlash, singer Lucky Ali took to his Facebook account to apologise for his post, in which he stated that the name Brahmans come from Abram. In his apology note, he wrote that he had realised the controversy surrounding his last post and that his intentions were not to cause any distress or anger amongst anyone. He went on to add that he deeply regrets the same. He further added that his intentions were to bring everyone together, but the post failed to achieve what he intended and "didn't come out the way I meant it." Lucky said that he will be more aware of what he will be posting henceforth and also keep a check on his phrasing as he could see that the post upset a lot of his "Hindu brothers and sisters." He concluded his remarks by stating, "For that I am deeply sorry. I love you all."

Now for the unversed, Lucky's earlier post implied that Brahmans could be descendants of Ibrahim. In his post, he shared that the name 'Brahman' is derived from 'Brahma,' which comes from 'Abraham or Ibrahim.' He further added that "Brahmans are lineage of Ibrahim. Alaihisalam, The Father of all Nations." He concluded his post by questioning why everyone is arguing and fighting without reasoning amongst themselves.

The post didn't go down well with a lot of netizens. Soon, the veteran singer deleted the post from his Facebook account.
