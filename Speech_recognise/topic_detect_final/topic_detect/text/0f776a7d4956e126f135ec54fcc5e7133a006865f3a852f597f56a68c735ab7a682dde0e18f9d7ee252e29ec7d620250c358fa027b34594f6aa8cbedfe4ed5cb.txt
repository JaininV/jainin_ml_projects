Just 13 of the 150 new emergency laybys pledged to make smart motorways safer have been built.

Ministers made the promise to build 150 more by 2025 in January last year after critics said laybys on the controversial roads were too far apart.

They are as far apart as 1.5 miles on several stretches, increasing the risk of stricken drivers becoming ‘sitting ducks’ in live lanes of traffic.

But just five have been installed on the M6, between junctions 13 (Stafford) and 15 (Stoke-on-Trent), and eight on the M1, from junctions 13 (Milton Keynes) to 16 (Northampton), since last January.

Another 40 on the M1 and M25 have either been started or are due to start being built soon. But at the current rate, National Highways looks set to miss the 2025 deadline.

Edmund King, of the AA, said: ‘They have failed with this patchwork approach of trying to retrospectively fill in for their previous mistakes.

‘Whether that’s filling in more emergency areas or, as we’ve seen recently, filling in with stopped vehicle detection technology after the schemes have been built, the evidence from 2006 and 2011 shows that all of those measures should have been taken then. This is a reflection of failed policy, with them trying to patch up the gaps. That’s not the way to go about it and really, they need to go back to the drawing board.’

Campaigners say that emergency laybys on existing smart motorways should not be more than 0.75 miles apart.

It can currently take a driver as long as 75 seconds to drift to an emergency layby if travelling at 60mph. But this could drop to 30 seconds under spacing of 0.75 miles.
