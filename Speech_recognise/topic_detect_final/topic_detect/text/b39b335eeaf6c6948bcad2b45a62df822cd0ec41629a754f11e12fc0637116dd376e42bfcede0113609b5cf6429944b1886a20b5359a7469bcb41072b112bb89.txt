A South Australian man who died during a fundraising walk along the Kokoda Track in Papua New Guinea is being remembered as a much-loved veteran and father who was a "mate to many".

Paul Miller had been walking the path with his son when he suffered what is believed to have been a heart attack.

The trek was intended as a fundraising effort run by veterans and first responders support group Operation Unity SA.

The group confirmed his death in a Facebook post, prompting a wave of condolences from friends and members of the public.

MP Tony Zappia also expressed his "deepest sympathy" to Mr Miller's family.

"A dedicated supporter of Veterans, first responders and their families," he wrote.

In earlier posts Operation Unity SA described Mr Miller and his son as "intrepid adventurers".
