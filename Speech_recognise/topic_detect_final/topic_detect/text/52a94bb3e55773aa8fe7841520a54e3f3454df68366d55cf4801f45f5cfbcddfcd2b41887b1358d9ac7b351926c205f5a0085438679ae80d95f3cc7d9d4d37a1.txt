“Stranger Things” fans already know the original Netflix series concludes with its upcoming fifth season, which should start filming in a month or two. But Deadline reports that the streamer still has plans for the franchise’s future. Netflix announced today a series order for an animated series set in the “Stranger Things” world, with The Duffer Brothers part of the executive producers team.

Flying Bark Productions will develop the series with executive producer Eric Robles in the lead creatively. Beyond Robles and The Duffers (though Upside Down Pictures), Shawn Levy and Dan Cohen also co-executive produce through 21 Laps.

No details on story, plot points, or “Stranger Things” characters involved in the new animated series yet. But The Duffer Brothers issued a press statement about the new project: “We’ve always dreamed of an animated Stranger Things in the vein of the Saturday morning cartoons that we grew up loving, and to see this dream realized has been absolutely thrilling. We couldn’t be more blown away by what Eric Robles and his team have come up with — the scripts and artwork are incredible, and we can’t wait to share more with you! The adventure continues.”

One imagines the animation of this new “Stranger Things” series will resemble what would have been airing on mid-1980s TV, but who knows? Considering there’s still an entire season left of the original series, with a final stand-off against Vecna in the cards, there’s a lot of story left to tell in “Stranger Things.” So, kind of pointless to speculate if this new show will be a prequel, a sequel, or an adjacent story to the main series.

Still, more “Stranger Things” is always a good thing for the show’s fans. If Season 5’s production schedule proceeds as expected, then the final season of “Stranger Things” will likely premiere in late 2024.
