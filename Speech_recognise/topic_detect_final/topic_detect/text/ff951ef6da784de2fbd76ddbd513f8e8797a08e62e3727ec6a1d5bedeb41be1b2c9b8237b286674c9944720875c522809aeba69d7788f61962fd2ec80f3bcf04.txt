On April 19, SM Entertainment released the following statement on NCT’s official fan community:

We would like to provide you with some information on NCT’s Jaehyun’s health.

Jaehyun experienced body aches so he visited the hospital and carried out a PCR test, and the result came back as negative.

Jaehyun was then diagnosed with a cold, but because symptoms such as high fever and sore throat continue to worsen, Jaehyun will take a break this week to focus on recovery and as a preemptive measure considering the possible incubation period of COVID-19.

Therefore, we would like to inform you that promotional activities for NCT DOJAEJUNG’s first mini album “Perfume” that were scheduled for this week such as music shows, fan sign events, etc. have unavoidably been canceled.

As soon as Jaehyun’s health recovers, we will make an additional announcement regarding NCT’s promotional activities.

We will do our best so that [Jaehyun] can concentrate on recovery while considering the artist’s health and safety as our top priority.
