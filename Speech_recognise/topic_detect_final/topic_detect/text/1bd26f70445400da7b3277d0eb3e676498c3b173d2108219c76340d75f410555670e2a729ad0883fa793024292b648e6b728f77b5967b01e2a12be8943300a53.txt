WIGAN WARRIORS head coach Matt Peet has confirmed that one of his forwards will be out for two months.

Following the injury to Mike Cooper, Wigan’s forward pack has been cut further by the injury to Brad Singleton.

Peet confirmed as such in his pre-match conference, stating: “Brad is looking at around 8-weeks with a strain which is unfortunate but that is the journey of the season.”
