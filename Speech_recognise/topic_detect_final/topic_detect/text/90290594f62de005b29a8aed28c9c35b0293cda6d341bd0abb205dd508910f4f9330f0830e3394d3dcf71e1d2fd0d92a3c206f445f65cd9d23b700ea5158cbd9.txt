KYIV, Ukraine — Russia is pounding the Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine ever more fiercely with aerial attacks and artillery strikes, but Ukrainian forces remain in control of the embattled city, the commander of Kyiv’s ground forces, Gen. Oleksandr Syrsky, said on Tuesday.

“The Bakhmut sector remains the epicenter of the fighting,” General Syrsky said on the Telegram messaging app, referring to broader fighting in the east of the country.

“This is where the enemy is concentrating most of its efforts and is determined to take control of the city at any cost,” he said. “Currently, the enemy is increasing the activity of heavy artillery and the number of airstrikes, turning the city into ruins.”

He also said that Moscow was attacking Bakhmut from several directions simultaneously.

Russian forces have steadily advanced on Bakhmut in months of bloody fighting, and Ukrainian troops are now defending a section of the western part of the city. The Russian Defense Ministry said on Monday that its assault troops had captured two more areas in the south and northwest of the city, although it was not possible to confirm the claim independently.
