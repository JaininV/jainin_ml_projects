Zeal Motors has introduced its new Fat Truck 8X8, which offers more than double the payload of the original amphibious all-terrain vehicle.

The 8X8 is designed to answer specific needs to transport heavier payloads or additional crew in harsh terrains. Available in two-car Hauler or Wagon configurations, the new truck can carry a payload of up to 2,262 kg or a crew of 16 workers.

The Fat Truck 8X8 made its first public appearance at ConExpo in Las Vegas. The truck will be used by the utility industry to facilitate working in hard-to-reach jobsites.

“A vehicle capable of traveling at 40 km per hour on land, 5 km per hour on water, and climb steep muddy hills with a 75 per cent grade, while meeting all the safety requirements, is an outstanding advantage that only the Fat Truck can provide,” said Amine Khimjee, Vice-President of Sales and Marketing at Zeal Motors.

“The footprint of the 8X8 is 1.9 psi at its maximum payload, which is five times less than a human. The innovative articulation allows the vehicle to climb vertical walls of 1.22 metres effortlessly. The Fat Truck 8X8 is truly pushing the limits in off-road vehicle capabilities.”

The Hauler version of the 8X8 Fat Truck weighs 5,910 kg and measures 8.18 metres long. The Wagon 8X8 weights 6,350 kg and is 8.25 metres long. Both 8X8 models are powered by a 173 hp, 3.8 litre Cummins F3.8 Turbo diesel engine.

As well, the Fat Truck is equipped with a tire inflation system that allows its driver to adjust the psi from 0.5 to 6 psi from the inside of the cab to adjust to terrain.

Zeal Motors was created in 2018 to solve the problem of moving people and materials to hard-to-reach jobsites. The company,based in Bromont, Quebec manufactures four versions of the Fat Truck to provide solutions for powerline and pipeline work, mining exploration and first responders.
