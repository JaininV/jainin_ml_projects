Tánaiste Micheál Martin has disagreed with the Green Party on how facial recognition technology should be introduced.

Mr Martin said he does not have an issue with it being added by amendment to an existing bill giving gardaí access to bodycams.

The Green Party has called for a longer legislative process with the technology introduced through a standalone bill with pre-legislative scrutiny at the Justice Committee.

Mr Martin said the particular legislative vehicle was not the issue and he was "ok" with it being added by amendment to the current bill before the Dáil.

But he said safeguards must be in place and a paper is being developed on that.

He said he supports the use of facial recognition technology in specific cases including child abuse investigations and murder and he said every resource possible must be given to An Garda Síochána.

Responding to a call from primary teaching union INTO to push for a special allowance to be paid to teachers working in cities to compensate for higher living costs, Mr Martin said that it would be very challenging to implement a pay framework to reflect that.

He said there are broader measures like the recent introduction of a renters tax credit that could be examined.

On a European judgment that could have implications for the naming of tax defaulters, Mr Martin said he would not draw any immediate conclusions on the impact on Irish legislation and the judgment would have to be studied.

He said naming defaulters had always been one of the penalties for those in default.
