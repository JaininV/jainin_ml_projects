The makers of Animal and director Sandeep Reddy Vanga have managed to keep details about the film under wraps. Not much is known about Ranbir Kapoor's character or the plot of the film. Now a video from the sets has also maintained the mystery around Animal. The video from the sets in London shows the cast and crew wrapped up in layers and they celebrate the filming wrap up.

The video shows Bobby and Ranbir celebrating with the team and cutting a cake. The clip showed Bobby Deol addressing the group and saying, “Every moment spent on the sets was very beautiful. It was amazing.” Ranbir who was beside Deol, kissed his co-star on the cheek and then the two together cut the cake.

The cake had the first-look poster of the movie, printed on it. The first look was released back in December 2022 and showcased a bloody and bruised Ranbir, possibly walking away after a fight.

At the time the filmmaker said, “We’re extremely glad to present the first look poster of this magnum opus crime drama starring Ranbir Kapoor. Ranbir’s look in the poster very well justifies the gist of the film and we’re confident that the audience will witness a film that they deserve."

Animal is set to release on the big screen in August 2023.
