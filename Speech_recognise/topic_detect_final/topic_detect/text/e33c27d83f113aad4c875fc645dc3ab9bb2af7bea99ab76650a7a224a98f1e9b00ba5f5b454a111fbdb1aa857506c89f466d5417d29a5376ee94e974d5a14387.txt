A Tennessee mother and son were convicted on charges connected to the U. S. Capitol riots, where they brought zip ties into the Senate Gallery.

Officials say Lisa Eisenhart and her son Eric Munchel, known as “Zip Tie Guy,” have been convicted on charges stemming from their roles in the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U. S. Capitol, court documents show.

They were charged with conspiracy to commit obstruction, unlawful possession of a dangerous weapon on Capitol Grounds or buildings and more.

The pair is expected to be sentenced on Sept. 8.
