The White House released President Biden’s tax returns on Tuesday, showing he and the first lady recorded an income of about $580,000 in 2022, just below their total from 2021.

The release came Tuesday, the deadline for Americans to file their taxes with the Internal Revenue Service.

Biden restored the federal government’s practice of sharing the president and vice president’s tax returns, in an effort to bring more transparency to the White House after his predecessor Donald Trump had abandoned the tradition during his presidency, CNN noted.

“Once again demonstrating his commitment to being transparent with the American people about the finances of the Commander-in-Chief, President Biden has released the most tax returns of any president while in office,” the White House said.

The latest return showed the president and first lady were responsible for $169,820 in combined federal, Delaware, and Virginia income taxes last year. The effective federal income tax rate averaged out to 23.8% for the first couple.

Their joint income stemmed mostly from Biden’s presidential salary of $400,000, which is set by Congress.

Other income came in the form of royalties from the Biden’s speaking and writing engagements, as well as Jill Biden’s $82,335 salary from her teaching position at Northern Virginia Community College.

Vice President Kamala Harris and second gentleman Doug Emhoff made $456,918 last year, with $93,570 owed in federal income taxes for an effective rate of 20.5%
