IT raids on film celebrities and popular film production companies are nothing new. However, IT officials raided Mythri Movie Makers’ offices for the second time this year.

In addition to Mythri’s offices, IT officials are “surveying” director Sukumar’s office and residences. Mythir Movie Makers is one of Tollywood’s largest production companies, with a number of major projects in the works. Currently, the company is working on ‘Pushpa 2 The Rule,’ starring Allu Arjun and directed by Sukumar.

Sukumar is also involved in many small and medium-budget productions as a writer and producer, in addition to directing ‘Pushpa 2’. As a result, IT officials are investigating whether they have any unaccounted money or wealth.

Sukumar has canceled today’s filming of ‘Pushpa 2 The Rule,’ which had just begun at Ramoji Film City in Hyderabad.
