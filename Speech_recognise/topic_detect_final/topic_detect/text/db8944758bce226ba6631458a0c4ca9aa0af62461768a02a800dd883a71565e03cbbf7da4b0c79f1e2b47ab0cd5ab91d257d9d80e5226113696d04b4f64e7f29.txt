I have been a member of this site since 2016. I have had times when I have been very active, and some times when I was not around for a period of time. The latter has been the case in recent months. There has been lots of “stuff” happen over the course of the last year. Some good, some tragic. All this to say, I always know that I can sign on here and get encouragement, love, and support when I need it.

The good news (well, at least part of it), was a move to Florida. Since I am new to the area, I feel quite comfortable going out as Emily without the chance of being recognized. I will often get dressed and go shopping, or for a walk. I am lovin* that part of my life right now. I do live in a small retirement community, so much care must be taken on my drive out, but after that, glorious freedom to be the real me.

When out shopping, I have found that confidence will take you a long way. If you feel good about yourself and how you look, that confidence will overshadow any defects that you perceive in your appearance. I’m sure that someone, somewhere has had second thoughts about seeing me, but I get called Ma’am almost every time I am out and about. I even had a young man ask me for fashion advice while shopping once!

All that being said, are there any ladies here in the Ocala Florida area? It would be lovely to get together with like minded people if possible.

Thats about all for now! Thanks as always for listening.
