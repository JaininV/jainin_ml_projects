Author Stephen King is pushing for “safeguards” to reduce high-profile shootings but suggests he does not want to outlaw all guns.

King tweeted about school shootings Sunday, saying, “America’s 2nd Amendment rights are being daily refreshed with the blood of children. If you feel the slaughter has gone on long enough, petition your elected representatives.”

America’s 2nd Amendment rights are being daily refreshed with the blood of children. If you feel the slaughter has gone on long enough, petition your elected representatives.

One minute later he tweeted again:

Very few Americans want guns outlawed. What many Americans want is reasonable safeguards aginst the homicidal and mentally ill.

King did not provide any specificities about what type of “safeguards” he wants to see “elected representatives” enact, but he comment that Montana’s lawmakers are against TikTok instead of AR-15s:

Michigan state Sen. Dayna Polehanki (D) appeared to think King was alluding to red flag laws and gun storage measures, as she responded to King’s push for “safeguards” by tweeting, “We did just this in Michigan with our new Democratic TRIFECTA!”
