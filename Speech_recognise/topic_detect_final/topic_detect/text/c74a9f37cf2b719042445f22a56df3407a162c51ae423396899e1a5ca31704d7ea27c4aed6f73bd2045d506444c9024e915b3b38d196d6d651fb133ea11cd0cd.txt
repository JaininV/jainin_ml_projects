One of over 180 microcredential programs approved so far as part of UpskillOK, an initiative of the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education, Allen and the other graduates of the program will become the first students to earn a microcredential from RSU. And with the school adding other such programs, they should be followed by many more.

“I am so impressed with Oklahoma and how far they have come so quickly with their program,” Placido said. “They have far and away exceeded what we were doing in Maine. There are really a lot of great, exciting things on the table.”

“We initiated a sort of competition, for lack of a better word, among our institutions across the state to create their own microcredentials to help fill this need,” Griffith said. “The goal is to equip detention and correctional officers with the skills that they need day one for that job.

“Microcredentials provide individuals an opportunity to come to a university and have that university experience and education, frankly, without a four-year commitment,” Sparling said. “I wholeheartedly believe that when we get them in a classroom environment, they’re going to come back. Microcredentials are going to get them out into the workforce. They’re going get to make a living wage with it, and they’re going to come back and complete a degree.”

“It’s an achievement that feels sort of like a degree,” he said of his first microcredential. “Because in any field that I go to, people will look at it and say, ‘This guy went out on a limb to achieve this and become a drone pilot.’”

“They seem to be nervous about doing it at first,” she said of operating drones. “But by the end, after I teach them the basics, and they actually get their hands on the remote and fly them — you see their confidence grow, and you know you’re making a difference.”
