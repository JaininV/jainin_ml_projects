WATCH BELOW: There were no injuries when a loose wheel from a pickup truck smashed into the windshield of a car on the highway. A video posted to twitter on Monday April 17, 2023, by OPP Highway Safety Division @OPP_HSD, shows the incident. The OPP reports that the driver of the pickup truck has their tires changed two weeks prior by a “buddy”. The message from the OPP is to make sure all tires are installed properly. Also important after driving a short distance, come back to the shop to make sure the wheel fasteners are properly torqued.
