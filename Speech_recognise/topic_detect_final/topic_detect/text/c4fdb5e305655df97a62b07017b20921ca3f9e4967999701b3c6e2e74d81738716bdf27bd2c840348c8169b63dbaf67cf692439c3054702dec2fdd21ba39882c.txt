After ProPublica revealed that billionaire and GOP megadonor Harlan Crow spent decades lavishing Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas with pricey gifts and globetrotting trips, follow up stories noted Crow is an ardent collector of Nazi memorabilia. . . .

The fancy Third Reich table linens were a steal compared with the fancy Confederate table linens.

You’re sophisticated enough to separate the art from the artist and/or genocidal regime.

You bought them as a thoughtful “cheer up” present for your dear but troubled friend Ye.

You need them as props for your passion project, a bio-pic of Albert Speer, because you’re Stanley Kubrick, and you’re manically obsessive about authenticity, and you’re still alive.

Using paper Third Reich napkins contributes to climate change.

You’re keeping them off the market because you’re concerned that they might retain traces of Hitler’s DNA, which unscrupulous scientists could use to clone him, or at least grow Hitler lab meat.

You’re worried that they might fall into the hands of extremist neo-Nazi cater waiters.

You’re preserving them as a reminder for future generations that elegant place settings are no excuse for unutterable evil.

The Nazi napkin drawer is the last place anyone would think to look for the afikoman.

Say what you will, but they go great with the Mar-a-Lago napkin rings. ♦
