A 50-year-old man has been arrested for allegedly driving under the influence of drugs and suspected drug-related offences after an accident along Jalan Sultan towards Beach Road on Tuesday morning (Apr 18).

The driver is believed to have hit a woman with his van.

The police told Stomp they were alerted to an accident involving a van and woman at about 7.30am.

The 33-year-old woman was taken conscious to hospital, a police spokesman said.

Stompers alerted Stomp to video clipsÂ of the incident that have been circulating online.

In the video, a man wearing a red T-shirt is seen lying on the ground.

A van with a Lalamove decal is seen nearby next to a signpost that is also lying on the ground.

The man is later seen being supported by police officers next to a police car.

An officer then handcuffs him before he is escorted into the car.
