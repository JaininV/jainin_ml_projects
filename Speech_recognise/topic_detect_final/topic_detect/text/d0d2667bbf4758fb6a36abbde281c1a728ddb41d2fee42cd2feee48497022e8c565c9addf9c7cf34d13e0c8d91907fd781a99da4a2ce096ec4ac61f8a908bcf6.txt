Air Canada’s Aeroplan and Parkland Corporation have announced a new loyalty partnership that will launch in the fall of 2023.

Mark Nasr, President of Aeroplan, said: “We are thrilled to come together with the Parkland family of brands to offer Aeroplan members a new way to earn and redeem points in their everyday lives.”

Nasr continued: “Our members have long been asking for a fuel partner, and Parkland’s extensive reach across Canada, their best-in-class retail experience, and their investments in low carbon fuels and EV charging infrastructure, make them the perfect fit.”

Parkland Canada President, Ian White said: “Our strategic partnership with Aeroplan unites two great Canadian loyalty programs and propels Parkland’s loyalty and organic growth strategies.”

And he continued: “Parkland’s purpose is to power journeys, and to partner with Canada’s premier travel loyalty program and largest airline is a natural extension of our customer proposition. We are excited to work with Aeroplan to accelerate momentum in our JOURNIE Rewards program and provide our customers with even greater choice and value.”

Together, the Aeroplan and JOURNIE Rewards loyalty programs will have a broader platform to build deeper engagement with millions of members across Canada, providing increased earning and redemption opportunities, greater choice in accessing new benefits, and an unmatched loyalty experience.

More details will be available leading up to the launch in fall of 2023.
