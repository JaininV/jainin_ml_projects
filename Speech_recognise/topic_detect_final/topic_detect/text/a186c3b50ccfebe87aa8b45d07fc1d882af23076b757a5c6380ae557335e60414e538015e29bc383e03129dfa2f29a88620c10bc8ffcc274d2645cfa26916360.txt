Mustafa Ali, who has been with WWE since 2016, has revealed that he doesn’t want to face Brock Lesnar in a one-on-one match.

Ali, who has faced several top superstars in WWE, including Bobby Lashley, Seth Rollins, and Randy Orton, stated in a recent interview with Okaz newspaper that while he doesn’t fear the 10-time world champion, he doesn’t want to face him either.

According to Ali, he doesn’t fear any wrestler, but he has no interest in facing Lesnar, whom he described as “scary” and “intimidating.” Despite this, the RAW superstar emphasized that fear is a strong word and that he doesn’t use it to describe any opponent he may face.

“Which wrestler do I fear facing? I fear no man. It’s just a man. Everyone says Brock Lesnar is scary, uhh, you know. There’re some intimidating guys that I’ve seen, but fear is a strong word. I don’t fear anybody. Would I like to wrestle a guy like Brock Lesnar? Probably not. But fear is not a word I use, no.”

Ali has been vocal in recent weeks about his frustrations with his position on the WWE roster, stating that he believes he has been held back due to his ethnicity and Muslim faith. While he continues to be featured on RAW, Ali has yet to have a significant singles push in WWE.
