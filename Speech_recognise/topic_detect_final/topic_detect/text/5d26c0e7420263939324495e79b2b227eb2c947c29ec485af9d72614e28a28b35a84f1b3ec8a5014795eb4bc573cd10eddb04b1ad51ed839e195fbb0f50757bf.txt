Chelsea interim manager, Frank Lampard has blamed poor finishing for their exit from the Champions League on Tuesday night.

The Blues lost 2-0 for the second time to Real Madrid within a week at Stamford Bridge and were eliminated thanks to a 4-0 aggregate.

Rodrygo scored twice for the holders to see off Lampard's men.

Lampard, speaking after the game, insisted it would have been a different outcome if they took their chances early on.

"Yeah, for sure. We played really well for 60 minutes. We created chances but you have to take them.

"You don't want to praise the performance too much when you lose at this level but we were much improved. This club has been further in this competition and the players can take this feeling forward with them for the future," he said.
