There is a new policy blog or political movement called Low Migration Australia.  It is very well written and explains the relevant concepts succinctly.  The movement was started by Edward Smith.  Well worth a look.

We have republished from the page entitled, "In a nutshell," from "Low Migration Australia" at https://lowmigrationaustralia.org/

Migration policy in Australia is just a tug of war between big business and the community, our politicians are the rope. The many justifications for high migration levels offered by media and think tanks are not determinative of migration policy. Business just pulls government harder than the public.

Migration levels are one of the most important decisions Australian governments make. Low migration can boost wages for low skill workers, reduce rents and house prices, protect our environment and increase unity, empathy and understanding in our politics and community.

Unfortunately, domestic big businesses (especially the property industry) either want the opposite of those things or are indifferent. Big business has bought influence in the political and epistemic systems and steered governments to high migration.

We have no grievance with any migrant, past, present or even prospective all of whom have merely walked through a lucrative open door, as many Australians would. We have a disagreement with the business and political leaders who want to leave this door open.

Low migration Australia’s goal is to persuade our business and political leaders to end their high migration agenda and to inform the community about migration policy. We do not vilify business at all, we want them to focus on the important work of running businesses and leave public policy to the public and their governments.
