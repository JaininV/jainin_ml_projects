Pioneers from all over the Kern River Valley, maybe as many as 1,000 people, are buried in the pioneer cemetery up the hill from the foundations of Old Kernville. The first known burials were in about 1870. Old Kernville had been founded in 1860, as the rowdy gold mining town of Whiskey Flat.

Francisco Apalatea (1850, Arizona – 1928, Old Kernville) was a gold miner and pioneer of New Kernville. Apalatea was born on the Yaqui Indian Reservation and educated at the iconic San Xavier Mission in Tucson, Arizona. In 1873, Apalatea moved to the Kern River Valley, where he was known as Poncho, dean of the prospectors. He discovered and sold the Bryn and other mines in the Piute Mountains, and by the early 1900s, had bought a 160-acre ranch, three miles up the Kern River from Old Kernville.

The Old Apalatea-Burlando Ranch House, now a famous landmark at Silver City Ghost Town in Bodfish, had been built in the late 1800s by Albia Curliss, sold to Andy Brown, then to Apalatea, who sold it to his son-in-law, Matt Burlando in 1915. The Apalatea-Burlando House, reportedly the oldest standing house in the Kern River Valley, was originally located across the street from the KRV Museum, where the Annex stands.

In the 1950s, when the Kernville Development Company was looking for a new townsite because Old Kernville was being flooded by Isabella Dam, it was Apalatea's daughter, Guadalupe "Lupie" Apalatea Burlando (1892-1955), who sold them the Apalatea-Burlando Ranch. Her husband, Matt Burlando (1886, Italy-1930), had already died. Matt and Lupie's children and Apalatea's grandchildren, Betsy (1911-1989), Johnny (1914-1995) and Billy Burlando, would be lifelong residents of New Kernville.

(Michael) Otto Liebel (Germany, 1850-1948) came to the Kern River Valley in 1876, and discovered some of the richest gold claims in the Piute Mountains, including the Jeanette Mine.

Liebel married Emma Reich (1883-1974), stepdaughter of Kelso Valley pioneer Frederick Butterbredt, and George, the oldest of their 12 children, was born in the Piutes in 1905. To get supplies for his family, Liebel had to hike two days down to Walker Basin, and then another two to three days back up the mountain, carrying everything on his back.

Liebel, like Apalatea, used his hard-rock gold to buy a ranch. The Liebel Ranch is in upper Erskine Creek, above where the town of Lake Isabella would eventually be established. Liebel's son, George Liebel (1905-1978), swore he remembered as an infant being packed off the mountain, down to the ranch in a barley sack. Records show that the Liebel Ranch includes more than 300 acres, officially homesteaded in 1926 and 1935 through the Bureau of Land Management. Liebel Peak, elevation 8,035 feet, a landmark on the skyline of the Piute Mountains south of Lake Isabella, was named for Otto Liebel in the 1930s. In more recent decades, Otto and Emma's son, Frank Liebel (1922-2003) and his wife, Virgie (Virgil Lesher, 1927-2010), had made their home on the historic Liebel Ranch in Erskine Creek.
