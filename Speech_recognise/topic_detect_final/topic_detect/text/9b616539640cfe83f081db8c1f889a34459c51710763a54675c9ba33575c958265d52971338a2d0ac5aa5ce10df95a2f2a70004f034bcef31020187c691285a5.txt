There were more than two videos of Mark on his racist opinion where in one, he threatened to hang a black woman and hiring someone to hunt them down.

Mark’s derogatory comment did not stop at that, as he went ahead to use the N-word and call women, ‘h*es*.

People on Twitter came out to state that his racism extended even to children he coached as one stated how sorry she was for parents who let him train their offsprings.

Just a snippet of the racism shown by so called Coach Mark Taylor @CoachTDawgs16 I am so sorry if your child was taught by this racist man. What a disgrace to our community in Middle Georgia.

It is rather appalling to see that his hatred for black is great, considering how sources reveal that 96% of Mark’s clients are black men and has worked with Dabo Luther King, Saban and others.

In Mark’s complaint, he stated that he “I ain’t seen a white person in sight. Homeless ones on the street. Every restaurant looking in here is Black. Every car beside them is Black. They can have Atlanta”

He claimed that Atlanta used to be a fun place but now that it’s full of African-American, he does not wish to visit very frequently.

Atlanta, he called it was a “ni**er town”
