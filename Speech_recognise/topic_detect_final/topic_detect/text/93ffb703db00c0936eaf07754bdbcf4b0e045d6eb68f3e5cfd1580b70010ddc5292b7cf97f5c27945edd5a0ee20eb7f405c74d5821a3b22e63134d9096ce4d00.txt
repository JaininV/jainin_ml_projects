NP View: Supreme Court can't be bothered to fix health care chaos it created       Perhaps, then, it should be seen as a breath of fresh air that, late last week, the court declined to hear the appeal of a case arguing that access to private health services should be read into the charter’s Sec. 7 guarantee of the right to “life, liberty and security of the person.” But it clearly highlights the type of cases the court is willing to take a bold stand on, and those that it’s more than happy to duck. And it leaves Canada in somewhat of a paradox.  We now live in a country where, if the substandard medicare system has left you in pain and suffering, you have a right to opt out by getting a doctor to pump your veins full of poison and end your life, but have no right to pay for the level of care you so desperately need. More importantly, in terms of legal consistency, we find ourselves in a situation in which the court has said that unnecessarily long wait times infringe the rights of Quebecers, but not those living in the rest of Canada.

In its 2005 decision in Chaoulli v Quebec, the court ruled that the province’s ban on private health insurance for medically necessary services violated the Quebec charter’s guarantee to the “right to life, and to personal security, inviolability and freedom.” But the court could not agree on whether that extended to people outside La belle province because the Canadian charter’s Sec. 7 guarantee can be deprived “in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice,” or by limits that can be “demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society.”  That contradiction has hung over the country for the past 18 years — 14 of which were spent by Dr. Brian Day, owner of Vancouver’s Cambie Surgery Centre, fighting to get some clarity. By refusing to hear Day’s appeal, the Supreme Court shirked its responsibility to sort out whether there really is a difference in law between Quebec and the other provinces. It also gave its de facto blessing to the idea that individual rights can be taken away, even if doing so causes demonstrable harms.

Last summer, the British Columbia Court of Appeal declined to overturn lower court rulings in the case of Cambie Surgeries Corporation v British Columbia, but did so in such a roundabout and nonsensical way that it was almost begging for the country’s highest court to weigh in.  At the initial trial, the court heard from numerous patients who had suffered poor health outcomes because they were forced to wait too long for medically necessary services. It was presented with a wealth of evidence showing that medical wait times were much longer in Canada than most other developed countries, and that the private surgery centres operating in B. C. had not caused harm to the public system. But these arguments were summarily dismissed.

The Court of Appeal’s majority opinion chastised the trial judge for minimizing the harms caused by excessive wait times and failing to acknowledge that restrictions on paying to receive faster care can lead to death. This, the court agreed, is a violation of the charter’s guarantees of life and security of person, but nonetheless ruled that such restrictions were in keeping with the principles of fundamental justice.            Colby Cosh: If you want expanded private health care in Canada, don't count on the courts        To “address the question as a matter of fundamental justice, for society as a whole,” the court made an abstract philosophical argument about what type of system people would choose if they had no idea what their lot in life would be and whether they would have the ability to pay.

Which was odd, given that we can look to virtually any other advanced country to see how public and private health systems can coexist and thrive. And because we know that our system has merely limited access to private care to the ultra-rich, who can afford to travel to, and pay for care in, the United States.  In a concurring opinion, one of the appeal court judges argued that the rights violated by the government’s monopoly on health care were not consistent with the principles of fundamental justice, but that they were “demonstrably justified” under Sec. 1.  When the Supreme Court declines to hear an appeal, it usually means the lower court’s opinion becomes settled law. But in this case, we have a point of law that the Supreme Court itself could not agree on in 2005, and even the lower court can’t agree on which circuitous line of reasoning should be used to come to its conclusion. If ever there was a legal question calling out for a firm resolution from the highest court in the land, this is it.  So while it’s heartening to see the Supreme Court defer to elected officials on such an important matter, this decision taints the court by giving the appearance that it picks and chooses cases based on ideological preference, and does not even have the gumption to rectify a legal contradiction of its own making.
