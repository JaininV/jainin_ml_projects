Where were we

.      when we began to see

most of these men

.      were half our age

and that any dream we had here

.      was mud-caked and attic-packed?

A body learns a lifetime

.      of committing toward the base,

of being waved again and again

.      toward home.

Winning is remembering

.      neither team escapes the fate

of swirling dust kicked up

.      from the slide into the plate

no matter how far they pull

.      their caps down over their eyes,

nor how the ump

.      will call the play.
