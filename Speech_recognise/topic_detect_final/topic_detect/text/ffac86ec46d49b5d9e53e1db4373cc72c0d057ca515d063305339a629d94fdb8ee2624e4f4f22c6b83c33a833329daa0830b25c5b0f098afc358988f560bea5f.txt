India recorded a

single-day increase of 10,158 Coronavirus cases, the highest number in nearly eight months, according to data updated by the Union Health Ministry. Medical experts have indicated that the virus' new XBB.1.16 variant may be responsible for the increase in Covid cases.

The increase in the number of cases may be due to an increase in people getting themselves tested for Covid as a

precaution when they become infected with the influenza virus

Amidst the COVID surge in India, you may think, do you need a

COVID-19 booster shot? So, let's explore!

Boosters are additional doses of vaccine that may be beneficial in prolonging protective immunity when there is evidence that protection from the initial vaccination series declines over time. Essentially, it is a

'top-up' of an individual's antibody-mediated immune response.

The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the way we live our lives and has had a

huge impact on our health. As the virus continues to spread, it is important to know if you need a

COVID-19 booster shot

Overall, it is important to be aware of the current recommendations and to consider your risk factors and exposure when determining if you need a

COVID-19 booster shot. Be sure to consult with your doctor for the most accurate advice and information.
