ABC’s procedural drama The Rookie’s fifth season finally returned to screens on Tuesday after a lengthy three-week hiatus with another crime-busting episode.

As the team of officers delved into a thrilling case, viewers were left distracted by Bailey Nune (played by Jenna Dewan) who was forced to take a personal day.

The Rookie kicked off with John Nolan (Nathan Fillion) waking up to the sound of his fiancée Bailey being sick.

She had gone out for drinks with an old friend, Libby and told Nolan they had the same plans for that evening.
