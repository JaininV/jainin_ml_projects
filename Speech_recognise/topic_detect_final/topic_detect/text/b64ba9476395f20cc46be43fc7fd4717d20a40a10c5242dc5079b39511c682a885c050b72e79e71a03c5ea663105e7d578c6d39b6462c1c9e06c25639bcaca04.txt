An East Huntingdon woman was charged Monday after state police said she misused the debit card of an 81-year-old Hempfield woman for whom she was providing care, according to court papers.

Samantha Jo Teets, 37, is accused of financial exploitation of an older adult, a misdemeanor.

Police said the woman asked Teets to purchase laptops, a printer and case for her, but later decided she didnâ€™t want them, according to court papers. The items were returned by Teets and she is accused of using some of the money to purchase a new Samsung Galaxy cell phone and accessories.

Loss prevention at Best Buy provided documentation of the purchases and return, as well as the use of the returned money to purchase a cell phone, troopers said. Teets returned $321 to the Hempfield woman who police said is still out $622.

The complaint was sent by summons to Teets. A June 20 preliminary hearing is set.
