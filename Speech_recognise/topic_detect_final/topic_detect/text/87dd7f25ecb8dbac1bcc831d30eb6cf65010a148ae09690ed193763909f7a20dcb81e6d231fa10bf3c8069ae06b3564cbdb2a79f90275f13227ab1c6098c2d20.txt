An American coffee cake is a type of cake that is typically served alongside a cup of coffee or tea. It is usually a single-layered cake with a streusel or crumb topping and may be flavored with cinnamon, nutmeg, or other spices.

The term can be used to describe a variety of cakes, such as sponge cakes, pound cakes, or even fruit cakes, that are typically single-layered and have a streusel or crumb topping.

The coffee cake does not necessarily have coffee in it.

However, in Britain, coffee cake refers to a sponge cake flavored with coffee, typically made with a combination of instant coffee and coffee essence. It is often served with a layer of buttercream icing and may also have a coffee-flavored glaze or streusel topping.

Let's take the best of both worlds to create the ultimate Eggless Coffee Cake recipe, shall we??

This coffee cake can be served for breakfast, brunch, afternoon snack, or as a dessert with some icing on top.

In this Yogurt Coffee Cake recipe, we will be using instant coffee as an ingredient to flavor the sponge cake base and sandwich a layer of walnut streusel in between to be served alongside coffee or tea.

* 368 gms (1.5 cups) Yogurt - Use thick part of plain yogurt. You can watch our eggless brownie recipe to understand how to weigh yogurt. Or simply use plain Greek yogurt if it is easily available. And that's how you make a Greek yogurt coffee cake recipe simply by substituting Greek yogurt in place of plain yogurt.

* 12 gms (2 tbsp) Instant Coffee Powder - Good quality coffee powder is a must. Or simply use the one you love drinking.

* 162 gms (3/4 cup) Flavorless Oil - You can substitute it with, melted unsalted butter but do remember that the cake would harden up on refrigerating so remember to bring it to room temperature before serving.

* 255 gms (1 cup + 2 tbsp) Caster Sugar - I prefer using Caster Sugar for baking in India. If you are living abroad then granulated sugar will also work.

Use only oil to brush the sides of the pan well. Add about 1/4 cup of flour to it. Shake the bundt pan well to coat the flour on all sides. Remove the foil and set aside until needed.

In a medium bowl, take the roughly chopped walnuts along with the cinnamon powder and brown sugar. Using a rubber spatula or a spoon combine them well until the walnuts are completely coated. Set this aside.

In a separate bowl, preferably a large bowl beat together the yogurt and instant coffee powder until it is light and fluffy for about 3 minutes or so.

To this add the rest of the wet ingredients - oil, vanilla, and sugar and whisk again for about a minute.

Place a sieve on top of it and dump all of the dry ingredients that is flour, cornflour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.

Do not bother about sieving it separately in a small bowl and then adding it. This is a forgiving cake recipe that needs just a bowl and a whisk to make it.

Since there is no butter or eggs in the recipe you also do not need to cream them which means you don't need to use the bowl of a stand mixer with a paddle attachment either. Isn't this a great recipe to work with?

So sieve the flour mixture directly on top of the bowl and mix to form a cake batter-like consistency.

Towards the end, you can use a rubber spatula to scrape the sides and bottom of the cake pan just to ensure that everything is properly mixed.

Pour half of the batter into the prepared pan.

Top it with the walnut cinnamon streusel and then finish off by adding the remaining batter on top.

Level it off and bake in a preheated oven of 180 degrees Celsius for 28-38 mins. Test it with a cake tester if it is clean your fluffy coffee cake without eggs is ready.

Let the cake sit in the pan itself for another 5 mins and then invert onto a wire rack and let the cake cool completely before slicing and enjoying this simple cake recipe.

A few simple ingredients, a bowl, and a whisk are all you need to make this fluffy cake with moist crumbs..

To store coffee cake, first allow it to cool completely to room temperature.

Then, wrap the cake tightly in plastic wrap or aluminum foil and store it at room temperature for up to 3-4 days or in the refrigerator for a week.

If you need to store the cake for longer, you can freeze it for up to 3 months.

To freeze, wrap the cake tightly in plastic wrap or aluminum foil and then place it in an airtight container or freezer bag. When you're ready to eat the frozen cake, allow it to thaw at room temperature for a few hours before serving.

The type of pan you use for making a coffee cake depends on the recipe and your personal preference.

In general, coffee cakes are often baked in a 9-inch round cake pan or a 9x13-inch rectangular baking dish. Yes, this recipe would perfectly work for this.

However, you can also use a loaf pan for making loaf cakes or even a bundt pan like I am doing today.

Additionally, if you prefer a thicker cake, you can use a smaller, deeper pan, such as an 8-inch square baking dish.

Prepare your pan properly: If you're using a bundt pan, make sure to grease it thoroughly with oil or cooking spray. Dusting it with flour or cocoa powder can also help prevent sticking. Do not use butter for greasing as the milk solids in the butter actually causes the cake to stick to the pan. Use parchment paper: If you're baking in a rectangular or square pan, you can line the bottom of the pan with parchment paper to prevent sticking.Use the right type of flour: For the best texture, use cake flour instead of all-purpose flour. Cake flour has a lower protein content, which helps to create a tender crumb. And that is the reason why we are using cornflour in this recipe. Plain flour + Cornflour = Homemade Cake Flour.Don't overmix the batter: Overmixing can cause your cake to be tough and dense. Mix your ingredients until just combined, and then stop.Add some flavor: Coffee cakes are often flavored with cinnamon, nutmeg, or other spices. Don't be afraid to experiment with different flavors to find your favorite combination.Make a crumb topping: A crumb topping adds texture and flavor to your cake. Mix flour, sugar, and butter together until crumbly, and then sprinkle it over the top of the cake or sandwich them like in this recipe before baking. Don't be afraid to experiment with different flavors in your streusel or crumb topping. You can add chopped nuts, dried fruit, or even chocolate chips for an extra pop of flavor.Test for doneness: Use a toothpick or cake tester to check if your cake is done. Insert it into the center of the cake, and if it comes out clean, your cake is ready.Let it cool: Allow your cake to cool in the pan for 5-8 minutes before removing it to a wire rack to cool completely. This will help prevent it from breaking apart.Add a glaze or icing: A simple glaze or icing can add a nice finishing touch to your coffee cake. You can make a glaze by mixing powdered sugar and milk, or make icing by mixing powdered sugar, milk, and vanilla extract or powdered sugar and lemon. Drizzle it over the cooled cake for a sweet and pretty finish.
