As the calendar heads into the second half of April, WPIAL baseball and softball hit the midway point of section play on the TribLive High School Sports Network.

Trib HSSN continues our coverage of WPIAL softball and baseball with a busy week of section action. We also have some WPIAL boys and girls lacrosse, along with boys volleyball.

Plus, the Rebel Yell podcasts swing into spring with another baseball and softball players of the week and teams of the week podcasts, as well as an update from around the WPIAL diamonds.
