You may have received one or two or 20 “end-of-quarter” emails this week. That’s because it’s the end of the first full quarter of the 2024 election cycle.

So far, we’re almost $3 million short of our $3 million goal for the quarter. All that we need is an illegal donation of $2,987,623 to hit the goal we unrealistically set for ourselves last December 31st.

Alternatively, we could receive 2,987,623 $1 donations which would have the benefit of being entirely legal, though hard to process by end of quarter.

Instead, we are asking for just 1,000 contributions of $2,987.62. Again, entirely legal, and I would personally make up the $3.

Every cent will go to Democrats and Independents who share the progressive values of Midwest Values PAC. Though, in the interest of complete transparency I will be repaid the $3 once we exceed our goal.

P. S. While I was writing this, we just got $18 in honor of the 18th birthday of a donor’s daughter who is a freshman at the University of Minnesota. So, we now need a thousand donations of just $2,897.60. By midnight Friday. Thank you.
