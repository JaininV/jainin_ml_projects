The young Eleven Is To One lads returned to action last Friday at the Adjringanor School Park in Accra, with an exciting encounter with Golden Strikers FC.

Cedar Stars at their familiar grounds, were, this time the away team as they share the same venue with Strikers, whoâ€™ve been a force at home.

On a quiet morning, it was a close game where both sides squandered a number of good goal scoring chances, especially in the first half.

However, Cedar Stars were not fortunate in the second, against the run of play, they were pinned back. Golden Strikers opened the scoring from the spot with just 20 minutes left on the clock.

Despite pushing for the equalizer, all efforts went futile and had to succumb to a 1-0 defeat in the first game of the second half of the season.
