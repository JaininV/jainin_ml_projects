What do you want to know as you look deeper into the season, to the trade deadline, and even to the offseason? Submit your questions for Jim Bowden on any teams, players or execs and he’ll answer as many as possible in another subscriber mailbag. From roster construction to prospects to early season surprises, ask away. (In case you missed it: Here’s part one of the mailbag, which is focused on trades; we’re still seeking more questions for part two.)
