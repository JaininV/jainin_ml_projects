“This is really a great chair especially considering the price point. Pretty easy to put together, very sturdy, nice looking and pretty comfortable. I honestly don’t think you will find a better chair at this price point. I am very pleased with the purchase and would recommend this chair to anyone looking for a comfortable home office desk chair.” — Amazon customer

“If you want a chair that is affordable but also comfortable and supportive for your back, this is the perfect chair. It may not be as comfortable as a gaming chair or a leather office chair, but it is also much cheaper than those. I sit at my desk studying most of the day and this chair is more than comfortable enough for me not to get sore while doing so. The only thing that this chair lacks is neck support but that is not a big deal as this chair goes. For the price especially, this chair is very comfortable and easy to assemble and I would especially recommend it to a student who wants a chair that is more comfortable than a wooden apartment or dorm chair for a reasonable price.” — Alec Gestenslager

“Sometimes items can be hit or miss and after reading the reviews I was a little hesitant about purchasing. I’m glad I decided to take a chance because it’s just what I needed. I purchased the pink chair which came with easy instructions, took less than 15 minutes to assemble. It’s cute, and comfy with a reclining option which I love. You won’t regret this purchase especially for the price.” — Amazon customer
