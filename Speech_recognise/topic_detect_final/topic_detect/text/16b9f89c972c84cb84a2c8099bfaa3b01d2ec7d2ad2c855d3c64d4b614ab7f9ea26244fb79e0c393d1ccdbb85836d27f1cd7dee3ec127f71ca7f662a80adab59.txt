Thomas A. Pane, MD, a double-board certified plastic surgeon and founder of Palm Beach Gardens, Fla.-based Atlantic Coast Aesthetics, has released a new patient guide that offers in-depth information about tummy tuck surgery, titled “Best of Ask Dr. Pane! Your Complete Guide to Tummy Tuck Surgery.” Click here to read it.

According to Pane, he has answered many questions about tummy tuck surgery over the years. To make it easy for people to get answers about this popular procedure, Pane says he was inspired to put all the questions and answers into one comprehensive guide.

As the guide notes, a tummy tuck, or abdominoplasty, will correct and tighten moderate to severe loose, lax, or sagging excess skin and the underlying musculature in the abdominal area.

In a standard tummy tuck procedure, the area of loose skin is identified and marked, and once the patient is under anesthesia, the plastic surgeon will remove the skin along a horizontal incision in the lower abdomen, right below the bikini line.

“The skin above the incision is then pulled down to meet the incision, leaving enough to create a safe margin for secure reattachment. Liposuction is used to remove lingering fat deposits which may compromise the end result,” the guide notes, adding that people who want a tummy tuck should begin by meeting with their surgeon.

Patients will have a final consultation the day before, or the day of, the procedure. “It is critical that you follow all preoperative instructions, including restrictions on eating and drinking, and continue to take any medications you may be on,” according to Pane.
