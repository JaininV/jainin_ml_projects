It is clear from the recent VTDigger article about Strafford dairy that the real-world value of its returnable glass milk bottles is much more than the couple of dollars I am charged at the store as a deposit on each bottle. I for one would be glad to up that bottle deposit to, say, $4 or $5 if that would nudge more people to complete the essential deposit-redemption cycle, knowing that we get it right back the next time we check out.

I also suspect that there is a disconnect between milk sales and bottle-deposit payments in the current food marketing system, which has all but abolished the idea of refillable containers. Who notices a small deposit charge at the checkout lane as a couple of hundred dollars' worth of groceries are being rung up?

Perhaps they need a tag at the dairy case that lists two prices for a half-gallon of milk, with and without the bottle deposit. Another tag could assess the environmental cost of nonreturnable or nonrecyclable containers.

I used to do home deliveries for a dairy that used glass bottles. They didn't charge a bottle deposit, but the rate of returns was excellent because every home-delivery customer was trained to put the empties out on the stoop the night before the next scheduled delivery.
