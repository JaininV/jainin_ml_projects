GSK has once again asked the Supreme Court not to hear its case with Teva over so-called “skinny” labels, meaning a generic is only approved for some of the reference product’s indications.

The case traces back to GSK’s win against Teva in 2017 in a court battle over Teva’s skinny’s label for its generic version of GSK’s beta-blocker Coreg (carvedilol). Teva’s label initially included two of the three Coreg indictions, but didn’t include a third indication for congestive heart failure. GSK sued Teva in 2014, seven years after the generic launched — accusing the generics giant of infringement by encouraging doctors to use the generic in a not-approved indication.
