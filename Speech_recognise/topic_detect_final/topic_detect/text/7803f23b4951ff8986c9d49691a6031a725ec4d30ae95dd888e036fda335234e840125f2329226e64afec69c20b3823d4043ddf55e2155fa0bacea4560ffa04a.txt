The Rotterdamse Kunststichting RKS (Rotterdam Arts Council) was an independent foundation to promote art and culture in Rotterdam from 1945 to 2005. In 2005 the foundation merged into the Rotterdam Council for Art and Culture, an advisory body, while the other tasks were transferred to the Art and Culture department of the municipality of Rotterdam.

The foundation funded by the municipality had an advisory role towards the municipality and local art institutions, provided subsidies to institutions and projects, and developed initiatives of its own.

In its sixty years of existence, the foundation contributed to the reconstruction of the city, offered a base for Poetry International and the International Film Festival Rotterdam, and contributed to Rotterdam becoming the European Capital of Culture in 2001.
