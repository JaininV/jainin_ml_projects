Oliver and His BFF is a sweet book for children. Prose by me, Cathy MacKenzie; illustrations by Angel  Sharum. It’s not specifically a book for Easter…but it’s about a rabbit, so it’s suitable for Easter, to be added to your child’s/grandchild’s Easter basket…

Oliver is a rabbit with problems. Except for his Best Friend Forever Reggie, the other animal kids make fun of him for his clumsiness, trouble with schoolwork, and his big, floppy ears. They even pick on his name. Oliver handles everything with courage, respect, and good manners. With unexpected help from his BFF, Oliver discovers attitudes can change for the better. OLIVER AND HIS BFF is illustrated with cute, whimsical drawings (black and white). Book suitable for all children, but especially for children aged 5 to 8. An early reader. Story involves various animals, not solely rabbits.

A children’s print book for $3.89 U. S.???? Who can/could resist that? Alas, the reduced price is only on the Amazon.com site and not on the Canadian (.ca) site.

That reduced price won’t last for long, so buy it now! https://www.amazon.com/Oliver-His-BFF-C-MacKenzie/dp/1927529522/
