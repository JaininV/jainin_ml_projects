Tone-on-tone d√©cor has had its moment. While minimalism is a style that's here to stay, the latest developments for interiors include warmer colors and softer surfaces. Also gaining popularity is a newer mix of shapes that includes rounded and organic forms. Still clean and clutter-free, minimalism is losing its boxy, almost industrial look in favor of more inviting spaces. Designers are taking advantage of the research and development conducted by paint companies by bringing in new colors such as softer whites, lighter grays, and earth tones in greens and browns, but also in yellows and reds.

While we've mentioned this trend toward warm colors before, what's really exciting are the innovative neutrals that bring color into a space, yet blend perfectly with other neutrals. Instead of sticking with gray-on-gray or white-on-white, open up your living space by adding something more unexpected, such as Sherwin Williams' Color of the Year for 2023, Redend Point.
