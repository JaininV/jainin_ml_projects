Director Ridley Scott’s epic drama, Napoleon, starring Oscar-winning actor Joaquin Phoenix as the titular French emperor, is set for release in theaters worldwide on Nov. 22. Scott and Phoenix previously collaborated on 2000’s Gladiator.

Writer David Scarpa (‘All the Money in the World‘, ‘The Last Castle‘) penned the script for Apple Studios and Scott Free Productions project.  A film synopsis reads:” An original and personal look at Napoleon’s origins and his swift, ruthless climb to emperor, viewed through the prism of his addictive and often volatile relationship with his wife and one true love, Josephine, played by Vanessa Kirby. The film captures Napoleon’s famous battles, relentless ambition and astounding strategic mind as an extraordinary military leader and war visionary.”

After its initial theatrical run, Napoleon will stream globally on Apple TV+.
