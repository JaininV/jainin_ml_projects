Flying Eagles-eligible striker Henry Timi Davies made his first appearance in this season's U18 Premier League as Arsenal and Leicester City shared the spoils with a 2-2 draw on Tuesday.

Before the trip to Leicester City, Davies had not figured for the Arsenal youth teams since September 2022 because he was recovering from a long term injury.

Gunners U18 boss Jack Wilshere handed Davies a starting berth against the Foxes and he was on the pitch for the entirety of the first half before making way for Luis Brown.

The 18-year-old arrived at Arsenal from Manchester City in March 2021 with a huge reputation, but injuries have slowed down his progress, having made only two appearances in the U18 Premier League.

He initially joined Arsenal on scholarship terms and the deal was upgraded to a professional contract in December 2021.

Leicester City had established a two-goal lead inside thirty two minutes courtesy of strikes from Leon Briggs and Amani Richards, but Arsenal mounted a comeback in the second half, having the deficit through Seb Ferdinand's header before Michal Rosiak scored directly from a corner to equalize.

Arsenal U18s will play their biggest game of the season on Tuesday, April 25 when they take on London neighbors West Ham United in the final of the FA Youth Cup.
