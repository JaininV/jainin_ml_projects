A group of Indonesian fishermen has been rescued from a remote reef off Western Australia's northern coast five days after a record-breaking cyclone raged through the area.

It is believed the men were stranded on the Rowley Shoals, about 300 kilometres off the coast.

A spokesperson for the WA Country Health Service confirmed the fishermen were treated in the Kimberley.

"Indonesian nationals were brought to Broome late last night and early this morning to Broome Hospital," they said.

Australian Border Force has been contacted for comment.

The Rowley Shoals were struck by 235-kilometre hour winds on Thursday, April 13, when Cyclone Ilsa passed through.
