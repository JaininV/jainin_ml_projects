Auto lenders are also adopting digital tools to expedite the service processes, remotely.

Nevertheless, since the latter part of the year, the demand for automobiles has shown a substantial rise, which has supported the automotive finance industry. The COVID-19 epidemic has also accelerated the expansion of online and digital platforms for B2C purchasing.

Furthermore, the increasing demand for passenger cars, the acceptance of alternative-fuel vehicles, and the rise of digitalization in the automobile industry are contributing to the market growth on the global level.
