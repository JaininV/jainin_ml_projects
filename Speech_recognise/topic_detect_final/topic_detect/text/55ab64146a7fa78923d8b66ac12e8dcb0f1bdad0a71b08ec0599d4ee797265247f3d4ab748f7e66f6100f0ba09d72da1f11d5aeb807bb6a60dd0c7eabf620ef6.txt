Fresh flowers are not only good for the soul — they are also scientifically proven to improve certain health outcomes. "Tranquil environments can provide relief from stresses of every day," according to researchers from the University of Bradford. "The presence of vegetation and wildlife has been shown to be an important contributory factor to rated tranquillity," they found, citing that visuals you would see in nature — for instance, flowers — have positive impacts on people's ability to relax.

Flowers have specifically been found to incite positive emotions. A Rutgers study suggested that our long cultural history of presenting flowers as presents, associating them with nearby food, or some special quality that has made flowers natural mood enhancers for humans could be responsible for the significant mood boost we get from surrounding ourselves with fresh petals.

But it doesn't end with your emotional well-being. The presence of flowers in patients' rooms has been linked to more positive recoveries following major surgeries. One study examined how patients recovering from appendix surgery fared when they had flowers in their hospital rooms versus when they did not. Patients with flowers required fewer post-surgery pain relievers and "more positive physiological responses" in addition to better moods. Though we aren't exactly sure why stopping and smelling the roses is so beneficial for our health, being around fresh flowers may soothe your mind and body.
