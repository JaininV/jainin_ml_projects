MUSIC AT THE HALL

Music at the Hall presents Joe Trio, the “court jesters of classical,” on Wednesday, April 19 at 7:30 p.m. at the Eden Mills Community Hall. Eden Mills is lucky to be able to welcome this Vancouver-based group on their province-wide tour.

Joe Trio is “not your average piano trio.” They regale with their wild takes on classical music, they intrigue with their unique arrangements of pop and jazz favourites, and they take the audience’s breath away with their musical talent.

Amply witty, charming and tremendously musical, Joe Trio performs and re-forms music from Papa Haydn to the Pink Panther Theme. They’re not afraid to mix together so many styles of music into a single piece it makes your head spin. What might be on the menu? Anything from Tea for Two to Paint it Black to Sweet Georgia Brown and even a Beethoven Trio.

Joe Trio was founded in 1989 in Vancouver and features Cameron Wilson (Violin), Charles Inkman (Cello) and Allen Stiles (Piano). They have performed throughout Canada and the United States, have made three frothy CD’s and collaborated with everyone from Stuart McLean on Vinyl Café tours to symphony orchestras.

We are excited to hear the trio play in the excellent acoustics of our heritage Community Hall.

“Music at the Hall” programs concerts and events to keep the village hopping, and to raise funds for the Community Hall operations. The heritage Hall is proud to be carbon neutral!

Here are some appetizers!

Oh Canada!
