Come and listen to researchers who have taken advantage of the Economic and Social Research Council’s Impact Acceleration Account (ESRC IAA) scheme, and learn how it can help your research too.

We are delighted to announce that University of Southampton has received its third IAA award with the ESRC. This showcase is designed to help academic researchers appreciate how the ESRC Impact Acceleration Accounts can give their research the boost it needs to achieve greater impact.

There will be an opportunity to find out how to apply for the first funding call of the new IAA award and hear how previous ESRC IAA award holders have benefited.

To find out more about how you can make the most of the university’s ESRC IAA award, to support with generating impact from your research, please come and join us for this interactive day.
