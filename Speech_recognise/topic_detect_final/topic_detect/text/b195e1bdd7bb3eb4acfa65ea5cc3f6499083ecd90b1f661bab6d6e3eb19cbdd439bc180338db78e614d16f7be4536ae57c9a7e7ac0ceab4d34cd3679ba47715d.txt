The retail prices of RON97 and RON95 petrol as well as diesel remain unchanged for the period of April 20 to April 26.

The Ministry of Finance in a statement on Wednesday (April 19) said RON97 would remain at RM3.35 per litre, followed by RON95 at RM2.05 and diesel at RM2.15.

It said to protect consumers from global oil price increases, the government will maintain the ceiling price of RON95 at RM2.05 per litre, and diesel at RM2.15 per litre, even though the market prices of both products had increased beyond the current ceiling prices.

“The government will continue to monitor global crude oil price trends, and take appropriate measures, to ensure the continued welfare and well-being of the people,” said the statement.
