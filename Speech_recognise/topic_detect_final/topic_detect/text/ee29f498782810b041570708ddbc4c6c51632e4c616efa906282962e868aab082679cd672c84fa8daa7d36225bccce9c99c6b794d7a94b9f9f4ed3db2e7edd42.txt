Donald Trump has had so many attorneys come and go (or go to prison) over the past few years, it can be difficult to keep track. Recently, Trump attorney Evan Corcoran testified against him to the DOJ grand jury, after the courts ruled that attorney client privilege didn’t apply.

If you’ve been wondering how Corcoran could be both an attorney for the defendant and a witness for the prosecution, the answer is that he’s not – at least not anymore. The Washington Post is reporting today that Corcoran is no longer representing Trump in the classified documents case.

Bizarrely, WaPo reports that Corcoran is still representing Trump in other criminal cases, including the DOJ’s parallel January 6th investigation. But here’s the thing. The rules say that a defense attorney who’s also a witness for the prosecution is not required by law to part ways with the defendant until things reach the trial stage.

So this isn’t simply a matter of Corcoran quitting the classified documents case in order to comply with the law. There’s something else going on here. It could be as simple as Donald Trump deciding he didn’t want to represented by Corcoran anymore in a case where Corcoran is cooperating against him. But if so, why would Trump keep Corcoran in place for the DOJ’s other criminal cases against Trump?

It really doesn’t quite add up. It’s enough to make you think there’s going to be more here, with another shoe to drop. When inside information like this leaks to a major news outlet but it doesn’t make logical sense, it’s often because only a piece of the story has been leaked, with the rest soon to follow.
