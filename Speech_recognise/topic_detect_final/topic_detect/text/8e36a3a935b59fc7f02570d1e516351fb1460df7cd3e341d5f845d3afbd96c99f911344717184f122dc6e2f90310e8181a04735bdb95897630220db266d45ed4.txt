A road is closed in Appleby following a chimney collapse.

High Wiend is closed to all traffic and pedestrians this morning until further notice because emergency services are at the scene.

All premises on High Wiend have been evacuated.

A town centre worker said that there was no access to the main car parks, which had meant widespread traffic disruption.

Police are also at the scene.
