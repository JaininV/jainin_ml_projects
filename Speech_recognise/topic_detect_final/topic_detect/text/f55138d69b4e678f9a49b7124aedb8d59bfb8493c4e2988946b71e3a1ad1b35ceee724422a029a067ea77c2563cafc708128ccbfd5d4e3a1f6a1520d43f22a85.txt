Emma Raducanu was swatted out of the way in double-quick time on her first clay-court appearance of the season. She managed only three games before going down to Jelena Ostapenko – the 2017 French Open champion – in just 59 minutes.

This was Raducanu’s third straight defeat, and it leaves her win-loss record at a moderate 5-4 for the year. Her ranking fell 15 places to No 83, as she lost the 100 points that she had received for reaching the quarter-finals in Stuttgart last season.

Were she to suffer another first-round exit in Madrid next week, Raducanu would probably drop out of the top 100 for the first time since she scored her miraculous US Open victory in 2021. It is even possible – although unlikely – that she could end up needing a wild-card invitation to play at Wimbledon.

While Ostapenko’s 26 winners flowed like fine wine, Raducanu’s shots had little penetration on this unusual indoor clay court. As a result, she amassed a mere six winners of her own in the course of her 6-2, 6-1 thrashing.

This was a lesson in how to play in slow conditions – but not one that many players are equipped to emulate, for Ostapenko comes equipped with thunderous power. The way to deal with her is to move her around, but Raducanu never established any foothold in the match, and merely ended up playing the perfect foil.

Towards the end of the match, Raducanu tried to dial up her aggression, stepping in on the returns and looking to impose herself. But Ostapenko applied a little extra kick to her serves, making the ball climb awkwardly off the clay, and Raducanu was unable to cope. In any case, this was a late adjustment which felt more like a desperate roll of the dice than a likely winning strategy.
