Nikolas saves Spencer and Ace! Nikolas Cassadine (Marcus Coloma/Adam Huss) is unconscious and held at an undisclosed location. There, he is on life support as Mason Gatlin (Nathanyael Grey) keeps watch over the Dark Prince.

GH Recaps: Currently, Victor Cassadine (Charles Shaughnessy) and company are aboard the Haunted Star. Spencer Cassadine (Nicholas Alexander Chavez) and his baby brother Ace (Joey and Jay Clay) were kidnapped as part of Uncle Victor’s grand Cassadine plan. We can’t forget that Liesl Obrecht (Kathleen Gati) is also among Victor’s prisoners. In addition, Trina Robinson (Tabyana Ali) is the only one other than Victor who is aboard the ship voluntarily. She snuck onto the boat when she senses that Spencer was in trouble. Evidently, Trina’s instincts were spot on.

General Hospital spoilers tease that Victor keeps dangling “family” in Spencer’s face. He acts as though all of his crazy antics are carried out in the name of “family.” But what exactly does that mean anyways? As far as Spencer is concerned, “family” is important to those who make it important. For example, Spencer believes his father didn��t make the family of great importance. Instead, he feels abandoned and mistreated by Nikolas. Now that Nikolas is missing, Spencer does what it takes to make sure his brother Ace is safe. That being said, Spencer feels like he’s battling Victor alone- with Trina and Liesl’s help, of course.

Although, recent GH rumors suggest some wild speculations about what’s happening on that ship. According to General Hospital rumors, Nikolas saves Spencer and Ace. Apparently, GH rumors suggest that Mason and Nikolas might be on the Haunted Star along with the others. We know Mason is keeping Nikolas is alive. However, we don’t know who Mason takes orders from. Maybe Victor is preserving Nikolas for his own benefit. In hope that some day his nephew can see things his way. On the other hand, GH news reports say Constance Towers returns as Helena Cassadine. Could SHE be pulling the strings? No matter which crazy Cassadine, it’s likely Nikolas won’t oblige. If he awakens, he can turn the tables on Victor to save his two sons!
