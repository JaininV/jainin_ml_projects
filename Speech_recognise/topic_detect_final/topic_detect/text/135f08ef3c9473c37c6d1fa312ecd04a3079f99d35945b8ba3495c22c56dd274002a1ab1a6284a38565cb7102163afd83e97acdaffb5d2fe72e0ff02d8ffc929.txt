It’s been a great 12 year on the field for the entire club, with The New Saints lifting the JD Cymru Premier title for a record-breaking 15th time, and The New Saints Women securing a place in the Genero Adran Premier Championship Conference for the first time ever.

Below, you’ll find polls in which to make your choice for both Men’s and Women’s Supporters’ Player of the Season – you can only pick one player from each team though, so think carefully before you do!

Get voting now before it’s too late, as the voting window for both awards will close at 2pm on Saturday, April 22nd 2023.
