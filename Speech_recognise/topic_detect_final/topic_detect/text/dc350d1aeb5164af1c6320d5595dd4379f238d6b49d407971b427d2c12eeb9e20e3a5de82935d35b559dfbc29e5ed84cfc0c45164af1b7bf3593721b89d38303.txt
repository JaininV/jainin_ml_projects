With Owensboro’s Dogwood-Azalea Trail once again in bloom, splashes of spring color can be found in the Griffith Avenue area.

The trail began in 1970 as part of a “Clean Up-Fix Up” campaign organized by the Chamber of Commerce. The Chamber’s Civic Improvement Committee formed a Floral Display subcommittee which encouraged the planting of dogwood trees and azalea bushes in the Griffith Avenue area and chrysanthemums along Allen Street at 22nd, 23rd and 24th Streets.

The trail was dedicated on Sept. 28, 1970, and officially included Griffith Avenue and its southern side streets from Frederica Street to Carter Road. Today, the trail includes the side streets to the north as well.

Many consider the centerpiece of the trail to be curvy Littlewood Drive, which features a median – cared for by the homeowners – packed with dogwood trees and azalea bushes.
