Nigerian artiste, Portable, has recently criticized his fellow artiste, Goya Menor, over a statement made by him during a recent interview with Hip TV. In the interview, Goya Menor insinuated that Portable was the problem and not him.

Goya Menor went on to compare the situation between the two of them to that of a dog barking at an elephant, stating that Portable was the dog and he was the elephant. He further elaborated that he did not have any problem with Portable, but that Portable had an issue with himself.

Portable has now taken to his Instagram page to react to Goya Menor’s statement, expressing his dissatisfaction with it. According to Portable, Goya Menor had no right to talk down on him since he had not achieved as much success as Portable had. Portable questioned Goya Menor’s relevance in the music industry, asking how many hits he had released, how many shows he had performed at, how many endorsements he had received, and how many cars he had bought.

Portable further emphasized that he had consistently released hit songs and challenged Goya Menor to come up with his own hit songs. He also mentioned that even those who had given Goya Menor awards were regretting doing so.

It is important for individuals in the public eye to show respect for their colleagues in the industry, especially during interviews. Disrespectful comments and personal attacks can lead to bad blood between artists and create unnecessary drama. It is essential to maintain a level of professionalism and respect for one another to foster a healthy music industry.
