A new study has found a link between alcohol use by men and the high rate of Intimate Partner violence in Papua New Guinea (PNG).

James Cook University Ph. D. candidate Abdul-Aziz Seidu was part of a team of researchers who examined data from the 2016–2018 Papua New Guinea Demographic and Health Survey.

He said the researchers were looking for a link between partner alcohol consumption and the experience of intimate partner violence (IPV) among women in Papua New Guinea.

"The prevalence of IPV among women is reportedly high in most low-income and middle-income countries, with PNG reported to be one of the countries with the highest rate globally," said Mr. Seidu.

The data included information from more than 3,300 PNG women in sexual relationships.

The researchers found just under 46% had experienced physical violence, just over 45% had experienced emotional violence and just over 24% had been subject to sexual violence. The study is published in the journal BMJ Open.

"Women whose partners consumed alcohol were more than 2.8 times more likely to experience physical and emotional violence and more than 2.5 times more likely to experience sexual violence, compared with those whose partners did not consume alcohol," said Mr. Seidu.

He said the researchers concluded partner alcohol consumption was significantly and positively associated with intimate partner violence.

"Some studies have reported that violence is normalized in PNG and that violence against women is seen as a normal aspect of an intimate relationship," said Mr. Seidu.

"Strict gender roles and gender relations that give men more power, while making women less powerful, could be another reason."

Mr. Seidu said there needed to be more effort to eliminate alcohol use by abusive partners, education of both women and men, and stringent legal consequences to reduce the high prevalence of IPV against women in Papua New Guinea.
