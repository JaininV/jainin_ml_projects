KUALA LUMPUR, April 12 —The #shotoniPhone tag has yet to get old and with the many festive celebrations held in Malaysia, iPhones will definitely get a workout.

While the best way to improve your photo taking skills is to take photos, inspiration helps too so here’s a selection of photos and photographers to help you craft that perfect #shotoniPhone snap.

There is nothing like a good flat lay when it comes to taking photos of food.

Mohd Zarnizar Mohammad, better known by his handle @zarnizar, is known for his gorgeous destination photos but he can also appreciate a flat lay.

“The art of flat lays is a game of balance,” he said. One easy way to get that balance is by using straight lines, such as the ones of a table, to help guide your photo framing.

He also says that it is important to show depth in photos.

“Most photos look better when they convey a sense of depth. Creating depth helps draw the viewer’s eye into the scene,” he said.

To help guide your photo taking, look under Settings for Camera and turn on the Grid option.

“Be experimental, try different styles until you can find your own,” he said.

For photojournalist Annice Lyn, taking the best photo is not just about technique and hardware.

“When working with people, build a rapport with them!” she said.

The process of creation is beyond just having an iPhone and how you interact with them also plays a big role.

With outdoor portraits, she said, always remember that natural light is your friend.

“For example, get the props/subject closer to the lens. It will create depth instead of just 2D shots,” he said.

He also said that a great way to elevate your flat lay shot is to lower the exposure for a cleaner look.

“Frame your subject to create a pleasing composition that directs the viewer’s attention,” he added.
