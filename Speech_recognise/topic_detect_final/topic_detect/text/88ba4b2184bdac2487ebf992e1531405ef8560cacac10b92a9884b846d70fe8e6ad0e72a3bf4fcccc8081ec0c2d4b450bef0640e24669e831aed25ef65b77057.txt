The New Scorpion 3+ Carbine From CZ-USA, Adaptable for any SituationKansas City, KS – (ArmsVault) – First released to the US public in pistol form – the new Scorpion 3+ Carbine has been developed based on consumer feedback and military and law enforcement personnel. This rifle rounds out the popular Scorpion 3+ semi-automatic firearm platform. The 16.3-inch barrel rifle is offered with two stock configurations. This configuration employs the iconic Scorpion EVO folding stock, keeping true to the design users have come to love. Three adjustment points allow the user to adjust the length of pull to meet their needs.

Ambidextrous controls are the gold standard in current firearms. The Scorpion 3+ includes an ambidextrous AR-style mag release and bolt catch/release. These controls have shifted position from the EVO 3 for easy-to-find, intuitive operation – essential in high-stress situations!Users will notice a notch in the magazine that accommodates the new mag release. New Scorpion 3+ magazines are also backward compatible with previous generations of the Scorpion. A redesigned grip ensures no issues with the safety of contacting fingers. A straightened grip improves ergonomics and control. The M-LOK handguard makes adding your favorite attachments simple.A re-engineered magwell features a recessed front radius on the lower receiver, adding more purchase on the handguard with gloved hands. The Scorpion 3+ sight’s lower ⅓ co-witness with a standard height red-dot optic allows users to easily have an unobstructed view of the target over the iron sights.The Scorpion 3+ is available in three variations. The micro features a 4.2-inch barrel, the pistol model features a 7.8-inch barrel, and the carbine offers a 16.3-inch barrel. All three utilize cold-hammer-forged barrels for accuracy. The micro is an extremely compact pistol for maneuverability in tight quarters. The longer-barreled pistol model has improved ballistic performance (over the micro) in a slightly bigger package, and the carbine is for those looking to add a stock without the need to SBR their Scorpion.The newly redesigned Scorpion 3+ models build on the success of the original’s proven features with enhancements throughout the gun. MSRP for the Scorpion 3+ Micro is $1299, Scorpion 3+ Pistol MSRP is newly reduced to $899, and the Scorpion 3+ Carbine is $999. Check out the advanced design of the new Scorpion 3+ models.
