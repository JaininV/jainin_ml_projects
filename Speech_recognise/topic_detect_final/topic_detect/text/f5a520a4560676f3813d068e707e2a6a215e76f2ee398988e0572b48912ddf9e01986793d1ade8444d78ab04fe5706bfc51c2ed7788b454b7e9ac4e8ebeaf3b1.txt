A once portly Rebels bikie who has shed a massive 52kg after recent weight loss surgery has made an extraordinary bid for bail claiming his new dietary requirements cannot be met in prison.

Joseph Raimondi also claimed he had been having issues with his new gastric sleeve, with his lawyer Mark Hager telling Perth Magistrates Court that the 35-year-old — now on a mostly “liquid diet” — had dropped so much weight since the operation it had become “alarming” and he needed to see a specialist in the coming weeks.
