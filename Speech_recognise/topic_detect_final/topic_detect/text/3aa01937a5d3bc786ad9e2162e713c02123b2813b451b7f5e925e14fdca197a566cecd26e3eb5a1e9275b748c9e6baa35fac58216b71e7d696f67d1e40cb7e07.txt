,  /PRNewswire/ -- Wisdom Natural Brands®, makers of SweetLeaf® and the country's first stevia sweetener brand, today announced their continued partnership with BAM (Brand Activation Maximizer) event marketing and architects of the 2023 Kroger Health Racing program that SweetLeaf is participating in this season.

BAM created a NASCAR-themed mobile marketing tour for Kroger Health and has connected SweetLeaf with the health-related program that promotes healthy lifestyles and living life at full speed.

Over the next year, SweetLeaf will be working alongside BAM to play a role in the Kroger Health pop up events that will hit 12 NASCAR race markets in several Kroger divisions. Additionally, Kroger Health Racing will have a major presence in racetrack midways with SweetLeaf, sharing tips for reducing sugar naturally with thousands of NASCAR fans.

Kroger Health, the healthcare division of The Kroger Co., was recently named Mass Market Retailers' (MMR's) Retailer of the Year. Kroger Health was honored for its consistent leadership in the retail healthcare industry and for elevating the connection between nutrition and health through its Food as Medicine initiative. SweetLeaf products bridge the gap between wellness and food, supporting this important Kroger Health program through BAM.

"Kroger Health offers a variety of services to help people lead healthier lives," said Tad Geschickter, President of BAM event marketing agency. "This continues to be the most exciting and important sponsorship activation. We look forward to making NASCAR fans aware of the Kroger Health programs, but also encouraging them to use products such as SweetLeaf to 'live life at full speed!'
