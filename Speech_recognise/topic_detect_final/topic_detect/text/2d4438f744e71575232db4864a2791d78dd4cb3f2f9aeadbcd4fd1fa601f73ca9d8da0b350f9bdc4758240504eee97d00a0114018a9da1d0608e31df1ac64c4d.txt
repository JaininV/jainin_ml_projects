The federal government made the day a statutory holiday for its workers and federally regulated workplaces in 2021.  The decision to do so is in response to one of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s 94 calls to action.  The prime minister said the federal government has moved forward on “living up and fulfilling” that call.  “That is a day that Indigenous Peoples wanted to be marking truth and reconciliation, and all the challenges and difficulties that came from that,” Trudeau said Wednesday at an event in Winnipeg promoting his government’s new budget.

“(The federal government) certainly hopes that provinces would realize their responsibility in the path of reconciliation and take on the actions laid out in the calls to action, but those are obviously decisions for the provinces to make.”  Orange Shirt Day falls on Sept. 30. It was established in honour of the experience of Phyllis Webstab, whose gift of clothing from her grandmother was taken away on Webstad’s first day at a residential school.  The Manitoba government closed non-essential offices and services the past two years on Sept. 30, giving most of its workers the day off. Schools from kindergarten to Grade 12 also closed. Stefanson has said that will continue this year.  The premier also cited the vulnerability of businesses still recovering from the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in her decision not to make the day a statutory holiday this year.

The organization responsible for advocating for First Nations in Manitoba expressed its frustration following the province’s decision.  The Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs said in a statement Wednesday that the province has missed a key opportunity to demonstrate its commitment to healing and recognizing First Nations people.  Grand Chief Cathy Merrick said the Manitoba government has not consulted with her on the issue in the last six months.  Some businesses and organizations have chosen to honour the day.  “I would like to take this opportunity to recognize all businesses, private sector establishments and organizations that have chosen to observe the National Day for Truth and Reconciliation by closing their operations and giving their employees the opportunity to reflect on the significance of this day and how it affects First Nations peoples,” Merrick said.
