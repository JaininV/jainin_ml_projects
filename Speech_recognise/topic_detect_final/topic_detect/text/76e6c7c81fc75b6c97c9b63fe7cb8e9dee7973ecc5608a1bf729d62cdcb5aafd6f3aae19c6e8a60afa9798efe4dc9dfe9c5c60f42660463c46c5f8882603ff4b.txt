One of many new projects announced today on the Warner Bros. lot in Los Angeles, a drama series based on the films in New Line Cinema's The Conjuring Universe is in development at HBO Max (which in May will become Max).

The Conjuring series will be executive produced by Peter Safran (producer on seven of the eight previous movies in The Conjuring Universe), with James Wan in discussions to executive produce as well.

While specific plot and casting details have yet to be revealed, according to the official announcement, The Conjuring series "will continue the story established in the feature films":

Based on the films produced by New Line Cinema and distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, “The Conjuring” television series will continue the story established in the feature films. Wan’s Atomic Monster Productions and Safran’s The Safran Company will produce in association with Warner Bros. Television, where The Safran Company is under an overall deal.

It's yet to be announced if Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga will reprise their roles as paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren, respectively, in The Conjuring series, but we'll keep Daily Dead readers updated as more details are divulged.

In the meantime, The Nun 2, the next film in The Conjuring Universe, will be released on September 8th!
