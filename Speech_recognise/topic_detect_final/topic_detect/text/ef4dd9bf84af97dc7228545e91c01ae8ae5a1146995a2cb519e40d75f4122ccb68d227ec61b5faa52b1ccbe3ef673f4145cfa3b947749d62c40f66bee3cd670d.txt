PETALING JAYA: Womenâ€™s doubles pair Pearly Tan-M. Thinaah have withdrawn from the Asian Badminton Championships in Dubai from April 25 to 30.

The world No. 8 pair were forced to withdraw after Pearly came down with illness on Tuesday (April 18) and this prompted national doubles coaching director Rexy Mainaky to rest them from the tournament.

Pearly-Thinaah reached the quarter-finals of the Asian Championships in Manila last year.

The top Malaysian women's pair were supposed to play Jongkolphan Kititharakul-Rawinda Prajongjai of Thailand in the first round in Dubai next week.
