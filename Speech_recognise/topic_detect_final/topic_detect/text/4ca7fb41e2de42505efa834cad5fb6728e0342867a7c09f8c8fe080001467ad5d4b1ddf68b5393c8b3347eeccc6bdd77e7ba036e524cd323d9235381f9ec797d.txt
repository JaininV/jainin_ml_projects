The Great British Bake Off's Matt Lucas has reunited with his former comedy partner, David Walliams.

The pair, who rose to fame on their BBC sketch show Little Britain, posed together as they attended Elton John's farewell tour, with Walliams sharing a picture on Instagram.

He joked in the caption: "I always make time to meet my fans, even during an @eltonjohn concert A bit tragic but he asked me to tag him @realmattlucas."

In recent years, the comedians have forged their own solo careers on The Great British Bake Off and Britain's Got Talent, though both have recently moved on from their gigs.

Lucas announced he was exiting the Channel 4 show at the end of last year, and has since been replaced by This Morning's Alison Hammond, while Walliams departed BGT amid controversy over explicit remarks he made about contestants.

The duo briefly reunited for a Comic Relief sketch, Rock Profile, though the parody didn't go down too well with fans, with viewers labelling the skit "unfunny" and "misogynistic".

Meanwhile, back in 2021 Walliams revealed he was working on a new project with Lucas, saying at the time: "We're sort of meeting up and we're gonna do something.

"Matt is obviously super busy because he's got the Bake Off and he's doing some other big, important things.

"We're gonna get together and hopefully do a new show, so we'll see what happens. Itâ€™s exciting."

The star added: "We've got to write it first. These things take quite a long time, creating lots of new characters and stuff, but hopefully in the next year or so we'll hopefully get something on the screens."

The Great British Bake Off airs on Channel 4 in the UK. In the US, it's known as The Great British Baking Show, and streams on Netflix.
