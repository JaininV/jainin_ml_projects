DANIEL WHYTE III SAYS WOKEISM WHICH HE RENAMED DECEPTIONISM: THE BLOB OF BEELZEBUB says you can ignore WOKEISM if you want to, but WOKEISM is DECEPTIONISM which is a strong delusion sent by satan and spoken of in the  Bible. If somebody is not truly saved and fasting and praying in the family and the church, you will suffer the greatest pain known to mankind because you will bury your children and or your grandchildren. After all, the SATANIC SPIRIT OF WOKEISM (DECEPTIONISM) leads to sadness, depression, isolation, separation from parents, emptiness, nihilism, being murdered, murdering, and to suicide.

As Daniel Whyte III continues to preach the series “WOKEISM: THE BLOB OF BEELZEBUB,” he says, “WOKEISM: THE BLOB OF BEELZEBUB” is so huge most people can’t get their head around it; they are only able to see one side of it, and they unwisely think that that is all there is to WOKEISM. Most people do not understand that WOKEISM is a satanic spirit that descends upon all people, not just certain groups. It works in and through lost people and saved people who are not prayed up and in the Word as they should be. The biblical definition of WOKEISM is found in 2 Timothy chapter 3: “DECEIVING AND BEING DECEIVED.” In other words, WOKEISM is DECEPTIONISM.

For example, some people can only see the side of Racism and Critical Race Theory; some people can only see the side of socialism; some people can only see the side of the ever-increasing abomination of homosexuality and transgenderism; some people can only see the side of the rise of ultra-feminism and the putting down of men in their roles in the family, in the church, and society. And so therefore, the truth of the matter is that President Biden is WOKE, and President Trump is WOKE. Democrats are WOKE, and Republicans are WOKE. Liberals are WOKE, and Conservatives are WOKE. Black people are WOKE, and White people are WOKE. Mainline liberal churches are WOKE, and Conservative evangelical churches are WOKE. Homosexual people are WOKE, and straight people are WOKE. And so on.

WOKEISM or DECEPTIONISM is a monster satanic spirit unleashed at this time and was rooted in what Paul prophesied as being a part of the last PERILOUS days: “DECEIVING AND BEING DECEIVED” or what Whyte is dubbing “DECEPTIONISM.” An example of this deceptionism on both sides is: on the liberal side, a Supreme Court justice says she cannot define what a woman is. And on that same side, others say that a man can get pregnant. On the conservative side, a former president and even people in congress downplayed the events of January 6, refusing to call it an insurrection and telling people it was just a riot. That same president, former President Trump, is running for president again after almost causing his loyal vice-president, Mike Pence, to be hanged because he did the right thing. It is the age of what the Bible dealt with in the Old Testament and the New Testament, people saying wrong is right and right is wrong. It is the age of deceptionism.

Daniel Whyte III is preaching the series: “WOKEISM: THE BLOB OF BEELZEBUB.” DON’T BE SCARED! As the wisest man who ever lived, King Solomon said, “There is nothing new under the sun.” God used the Apostle Paul to predict what we call WOKEISM. The problem is that today’s Judas, Laodicean church was not ready for it. She took the thirty pieces of silver and was devastated by it to the point that over half of the Evangelical, Baptist, Charismatic, Methodist, Bible, Presbyterian, and what we know as Protestant churches, along with the Pope and the Catholic church, have fallen away through the satanic power of WOKEISM: THE BLOB OF BEELZEBUB — DECEPTIONISM.
