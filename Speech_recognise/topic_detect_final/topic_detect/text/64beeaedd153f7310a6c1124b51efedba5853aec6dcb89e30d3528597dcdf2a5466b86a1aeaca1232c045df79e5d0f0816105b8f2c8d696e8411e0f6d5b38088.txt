Baobab is an AMAZING superfood recommended by Trim Healthy Mama, and I have been ALL IN since I first heard about it! I made a list of my favorite Trim Healthy Mama Baobab recipes – even though I know it's good for me, in the past I've had a hard time thinking of creative ways to use it. This list has been a huge help and I refer to it often!

According to Healthline.com, “Powdered baobab contains many important nutrients but is especially high in vitamin C, vitamin B6, niacin, iron and potassium.”

According to Trim Healthy Mama, “baobab offers the highest antioxidant levels of any food on the planet with 2x the calcium of milk, 2x the magnesium and iron of spinach, and 6x the potassium of bananas.” You can learn more about Baobab in the Trim Healthy Mama baobab Superfood Spotlights in THM Poddy #'s 45, 85, 168, and 179. (Pssst – scroll down for the big list of Baobab ideas!).

Even better – Trim Healthy Mama Baobab is excellent quality and often on sale! I buy my baobab here!

I've made a list of over 30 favorite Baobab recipe ideas to share! You can copy and paste the list below, or sign up at the bottom of this post to get a PDF printable version (with some bonus ideas!) that you can save and refer back to whenever you need some fresh inspiration!

In the list below, “THF” stands for the book Trim Healthy Future.

THM Hydrates – the Cherry Berry Baobab flavor is my latest favorite! (Please be sure to select the “Cherry Berry Baobab”, not just “Cherry Berry” to get the extra Baobab Boost. I've ordered the wrong one before by accident!)

I LOVE the Hydrates (I ordered one of each of the packets and the bulk mix). You can read about my flavor reviews here: Review of THM Hydrates I have to confess that the Cherry Berry Baobab is my new favorite, but I still love the others!
