In the past 20 years, I have had cable, streaming and satellite packages and always had to pay for Fox News in every one of them. The packages were expensive and adding insult to injury was the occasional news story about how Fox was holding up these companies for more ransom in their contracts.

I thought about putting parental controls on my lineup so that no one and I mean NO ONE would be able to suck off the Fox News teat while they were in my house.

But then I thought, my friends are adults. I shouldn’t have the right to control what they want to watch. I’m not a control freak in general and don’t want to dominate people with irritating and sometimes capricious rules. I have acquaintances and a parent who used to do that. Why should I want to be like that??

Then I sat down last year and did the math. No matter what package I got, I wasn’t getting my money’s worth because all of the things I wanted to see were by subscription only and the things I could see for free included a boatload of reality TV and Fox News. I had zero interest in either.

So I dumped the packages and now stream only subscription services. I can’t watch Penguins games and there are some news channels I can’t get anymore but there are workarounds, like podcasts, so I’m not really missing much.

But why should anyone pay for Fox News if they don’t want it? There are very good reasons for not wanting to pay for Fox News:

* It lies to its audience and promotes inflammatory narratives.

* Its programming is violent and makes its audience very fearful

* It promotes an authoritarian and reactionary worldview

* It is partially responsible for the insurrection of January 6

* It excuses and tolerates cruel behavior towards others

* It doesn’t adhere to journalistic principles and hides truthful facts from its viewers, preventing the audience from making informed choices about their behavior.

It’s dangerous, unAmerican, authoritarian, promotes discrimination and inequality. Increasing inequality leads to instability. Instability leads to economic fluctuations and inconsistent delivery of governmental services. When more things go wrong, systems collapses are a looming threat.

Fox News isn’t terribly concerned with any of that. It’s just chasing profits. They’ll all be dead soon and YOLO. What happens to the country is our problem, not theirs. In fact, the worse things get, the better for ratings as Fox pumps up the volume on violence and other threats to its viewers, making them anxious, angry and looking around for a big man to take care of them.

And if that’s what they want, why should ANY of us pay for that? Why is Fox News included in every basic content package? It’s a dangerous product that should come with a black box warning. It’s as addictive as crack to those oriented in its direction. It’s everywhere in waiting rooms and diners.

The users who just can’t get enough of it should pay for it as a subscription service and not one fraction of a cent of anybody else’s hard earned discretionary income should go towards funding the destruction of our culture and country.
