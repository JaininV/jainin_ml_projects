Former President Donald Trump is intensifying his attacks on Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and other potential 2024 GOP foes for their current or past support of scaling back Social Security and Medicare benefits, placing tensions over reforming the two programs at the center of the early phase of the primary campaign.
