A woman has taken to TikTok to share her 'solution' to tanning while using a sunbed, but not everyone agrees.

Though, popping to the tanning salon isn’t enough for the beauty fanatic, who wants an extra boost when going under the rays.

Bethany follows a specific routine in order to get that bronze glow and it doesn’t include traditional methods like using suncream. In fact, it’s a natural element you might not think about when wanting to boost your colour.

The TikTok user shared a video explaining that she uses a salt water mix in a spray bottle while inside of the sunbed for maximum effect, even showing the aftermath and tan line from a session.

While recommending the 'hack' to others on the video-sharing app, Bethany said: ''Salt water helps remove dead skin cells from your skin and increases the UV rays/sun (if outside) hitting your skin.

With a following of 28.2k, the video quickly went viral as many flooded into the comment section to put in their two pence about the beauty 'trick'.

While some were encouraging and supportive of Bethany’s method, the majority gave warnings to the poster about the dangers of sunbeds and their link to skin cancer.

According to the NHS website, sunbeds give out ultraviolet rays that ‘increase your risk of developing skin cancer’ and that these risks are ‘far greater to young people’ due to many factors which include their exposure to UV rays before the age of 25.

There is an overwhelming amount of evidence to show that using tanning beds causes melanoma and that they give out the ‘same type of harmful radiation as sunlight’.

When questioned why she would use salt water on her skin, Bethany replied that she lives close to the beach which made obtaining the liquid easy for her.

One particular TikTok user seemed concerned for her health and commented: ''This seems really dangerous.''

However, some comments were left by those who were looking for the specific type of salt needed to give it a go themselves.
