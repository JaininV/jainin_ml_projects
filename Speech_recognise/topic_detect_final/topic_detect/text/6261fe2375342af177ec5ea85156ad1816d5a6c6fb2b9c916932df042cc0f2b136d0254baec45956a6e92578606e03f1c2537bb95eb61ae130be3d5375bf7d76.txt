Kaizer Chiefs have been proactive about their transfer business ahead of the new campaign, but new signings from other PSL clubs are not the only avenue to new talent arriving at Naturena.

Given Msimango and Thatayaone Ditlhowke will add some much-needed PSL know-how and leadership to the Chiefs backline. The huge upside with the pair is that they’re both still young; 25-year-old Msimango is already captaining TS Galaxy and 24-year-old Ditlhowke skippers the Botswana national team. Cape Town City playmaker Mduduzi Mdantsane, meanwhile, is widely expected to join the ranks. That’s a lot of PSL-ready quality.

JALI or JABAAR ? That is the question for Chiefs

Aside from senior additions, the Glamour Boys are also adding talent from the academy to the first-team fold.

Omega Mdaka is a stocky, compact left-back who’s still just 19 years old. With Sifisi Hlanti the wrong side of 30, it’s a shrewd time to blood a new player in that position. Donay Jansen, meanwhile, is an exciting winger who could be ready to step up to the big time. Chiefs have Mduduzi Shabalala in wide areas, but Mdu has recretly excelled in the number 10 role. Another exciting wide attacker is a more than welcome addition for Arthur Zwane.

Will Chiefs add even more quality via the transfer market? Good things are happening at Naturena and there’s clearly plenty to shout about for the next campaign.
