Join us for today’s podcast with Stasi’s dear friend Ann Marie Farren of Scotland. Jesus captured Ann Marie’s heart at an early age, then invited her to remain single for him. It’s a decision Ann Marie has never regretted in the 40 years of her daily Romance with the Resurrected One. An integral member of her church community, Ann Marie’s mission is to invite others to know our great God, who forever captured her heart.

Psalm 45:2 (NKJV) — You are fairer than the sons of men; Grace is poured upon Your lips; Therefore God has blessed You forever.

Proverbs 16:6 (NIV) — Through love and faithfulness sin is atoned for.
