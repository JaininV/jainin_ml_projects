Abbey Weitzeil seems to have found a formula thatâ€™s working for her, as the Cal sprinter took wins in Westmont this weekend in the 50 free (24.5) and 100 free (53.3). Weitzeil says the break she took last summer was much needed and it allowed her to come back with a new mindset that focuses on being the best athlete she can be at all times.
