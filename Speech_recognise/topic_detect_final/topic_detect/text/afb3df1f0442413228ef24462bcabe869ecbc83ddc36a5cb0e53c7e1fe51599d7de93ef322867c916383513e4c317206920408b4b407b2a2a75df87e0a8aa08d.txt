MAGA Rapper Loza Alexander just released his newest song “Indicted We Stand” in response to the indictment of Former President Donald Trump. He completed the song despite undergoing cancer treatment for blood cancer just days before it was released.

On his website Loza is described as an American artist looking to bring back the faith and freedom in every patriot world wild through his music.

Loza skyrocketed to fame in October of 2021 after the release of his song “Let’s Go Brandon.” With that song, Loza came in at No. 1 on Billboard’s Emerging Artists chart for October and was recognized as the top emerging act in the U. S. for the first time. The song originated when NASCAR driver Brandon Brown won a race at the Talladega Superspeedway on Oct. 2, 2021. During his post-interview with an NBC Sports reporter, fans could be heard in the background shouting a profane anti-President Joe Biden chant. The reporter suggested that the crowd was instead chanting, “Let’s go, Brandon,” to celebrate his win.

Loza rolled out his new song “Indicted We Stand,” on YouTube, the same day former President Trump flew from his home in Mar-a-Lago, Florida, to New York City, where he will be arraigned Tuesday on charges related to hush money paid to adult film actress Stormy Daniels in 2016.

The song calls for authorities to “free Donald Trump” and “lock Joe Biden up” several times before the chorus of: “Indicted we stand, indicted we fall, Trump get locked up, it’s a wrap for us all.” Other lyrics include: “It’s a witch hunt, ain’t no crime at all” and “Trump would never mess with that thang” referring to Stormy Daniels.

Loza announced “Indicted We Stand” in a tweet April 3 saying, “New song out now Indicted We Stand, I got this song done despite of my cancer issues because the American people needed it, #trump #indictment #trumpindictment #anthem.

In another tweet, Loza predicted “Indicted We Stand” will reach #1 after debuting as the #2 Hip-Hop/Rap song.

And he posted his support for Donald Trump on Truth Social:
