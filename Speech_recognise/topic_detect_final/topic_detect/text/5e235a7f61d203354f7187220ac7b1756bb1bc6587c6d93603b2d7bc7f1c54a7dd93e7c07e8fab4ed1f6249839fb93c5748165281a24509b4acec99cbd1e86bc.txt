Police arrest fourth and final suspect in 2021 shooting death of 16-year-old rapper in Ottawa

Ottawa police said a youth who was wanted on a Canada-wide arrest warrant was “located and arrested” on Monday.

The 17-year-old youth, who cannot be named, appeared in court Tuesday afternoon where he was formally charged with first-degree murder, attempted murder and accessory to murder after the fact.

He was represented by his lawyer, Dominique Smith.

The youth was ordered to avoid communication with a list of 10 people, including the three others who had been already charged in connection with Ndayishimiye’s shooting death on Dec. 6, 2021.

Police said Tuesday the youth is the final person to be charged in connection with the killing and that no other suspects are wanted.

Noel Perez, 26, of Ottawa, was previously charged with first-degree murder and another youth, whose name can’t be released under provisions of the Youth Criminal Justice Act, also faces a charge of first-degree murder in the case.
