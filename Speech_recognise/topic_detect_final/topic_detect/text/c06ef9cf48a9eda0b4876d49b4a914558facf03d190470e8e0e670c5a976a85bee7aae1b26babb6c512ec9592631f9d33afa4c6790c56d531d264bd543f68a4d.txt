Prime Minister Nicolae Ciuca stated that within the discussions carried out on Wednesday, at the Victoria Palace, with European Commissioner for Internal Market Thierry Breton, he reiterated the support for strengthening the defence capability of the European Union, underscoring the fact that Romania achieved its objectives to earmark 2pct of the GDP for the 2023 defence budget.

The Executive head hold joint statements with Thierry Breton, the European Commissioner for Internal market, who is on an official visit to Romania.

"Within the discussions, I have reiterated Romania's support for the strengthening of the European defence capability. I have talked about the fact that Romania achieved its objectives to earmark 2pct of the GDP for the defence budget this year, We are talking about taking on the increase of this percentage to 2.5, which means that we have a larger specter for the approaches that have been and still are on the working agenda of both the European Union and the North-Atlantic Alliance. Certainly, it is a commitment of the European Union to strengthen the defence capabilities, in re-launching the defence industry in the context of the war in Ukraine, but, at the same time, it is an outlook I have discussed with Mr commissioner in terms of our ability to prepare and strengthen resilience and capabilities to manage not only the current challenges, but the future challenges," Nicolae Ciuca stated.

He mentioned that Thierry Breton will tour a part of our facilities in the defence industry, the European Cybersecurity Competence Centre (ECCC) in Bucharest and, he will also have meetings with Romanian officials, with members of the Government and with members of the defence industry.

Regarding the ECCC, which will open very soon in Bucharest, on 9 May, he underscored that it represents a presence of special importance on the territory of Romania.

The prime minister also mentioned the aspects regarding competitiveness and the level of ambition of the EU in terms of green transition.

"The recent proposals presented by the European Commission, such as the 'Green Deal' industrial plan, the Net-Zero Industry Act, the European Critical Raw Materials Act and the Communication on the EU's long-term competitiveness, as I have mentioned to Mr commissioner, come at a time and they must be addressed in such a way that we meet these objectives, which are politically assumed and they must be put into practice. I have insisted that initiatives aimed at supporting the European Union's green and digitisation objectives must remain neutral in terms of the technologies used to decarbonise," Ciuca said.

In this context, he thanked the EU officials for the support granted to our country for the development of reactors 3 and 4 of Cernavoda.

Last, but not least, the prime minister underscored the fact that within the meeting also tackled were topics related to the further support for Ukraine and the Republic of Moldova.
