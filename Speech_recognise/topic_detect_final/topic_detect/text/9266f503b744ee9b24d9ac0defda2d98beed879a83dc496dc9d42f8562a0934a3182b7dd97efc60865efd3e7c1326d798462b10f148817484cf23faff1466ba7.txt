Have you heard the rumor? The Masters Tournament has a secret menu item called the Secret Masters Stand 12 Drink Recipe. Stand 12 is a light thirst-quenching layered drink served in a clear Masters cup created by one of the concession stand workers.

The Masters Golf Tournament is all about traditions. They have served the same concession stand favorites, such as Masters Famous Pimento Cheese, Masters Chicken Salad,  and Egg Salad Sandwiches, for over 50 years. However, did you know there is a secret menu that breaks free from tradition?

The¬†secret menu¬†is not written on the big menu signs when you enter the concession stands. You need to know where to go and what to ask for to get this secret menu item.

News Flash: I was contacted by a Masters stand 12 worker, and she said they are "no longer allowed to make concoction drinks anymore."  So, be sure to pin this recipe for later and print the recipe card at the bottom so you can make your own Stand 12 Drink.

* Pink lemonade: I suggest purchasing Minute-Maid since the National has Coco-Cola in their concession stands. Do not use diet lemonade. You need the sugar to make the lemonade heavy so it layers nicely.

* Blue Powerade: You could also use Gatorade if you prefer.

* Sprite: You can use 7up or any other lemon-lime fizzy soda.

Important Tip: Do not use diet products to make this layered drink. You must have the weight from the sugar to get separated layers.

Fill a clear Masters cup or highball glass 1/2 way with ice. This step helps chill the glass.

Pour the pink lemonade into the glass, filling it about one-third of the way full.

Using the back of a bar spoon, gently pour the Sprite on the spoon so it dribbles over the lemonade. You want about an inch of Sprite to go on top of the lemonade.

Next, using the back of the bar spoon, slowly pour the blue Powerade on the back of the spoon and then onto the pink lemonade and Sprite layers. Fill the glass almost to the top.

Note:¬†The layering effect may take a bit of practice to achieve. Read the tips below on how to layer a cocktail or drink.

Chill the glass:¬†Start by chilling the glass in the freezer for a few minutes before you begin layering the drink. Chilling will help the layers to settle and create a cleaner line between them. If the recipe calls for ice, add it at this stage.

Add the heaviest liquid first:¬†Pour the heaviest liquid into the glass first. This is usually a syrup, juice, or liqueur that will form the drink's base.

Place a spoon over the glass: Take a spoon and place it upside down over the top of the glass so that the rounded side is facing upwards.

Pour the next liquid slowly:¬†Slowly pour the next liquid over the back of the spoon, allowing it to trickle into the glass. The spoon helps to slow down the flow of the liquid, which will prevent it from mixing with the first layer. Pour the liquid in a circular motion to create an even layer.

Repeat:¬†Repeat this process with each layer of liquid, making sure to pour each one slowly and evenly. You may need to adjust the spoon's angle or the pour's speed for the best results. Practice makes perfect.

Add garnish: Once all the layers are in place, you can add a garnish to the top of the drink. A garnish could be a citrus wedge, a sprig of herbs, or anything else that complements the flavors in the cocktail.

Remember, layering a cocktail takes practice, so don't be discouraged if your first attempt isn't perfect. Keep practicing and experimenting with different combinations of ingredients to find your perfect layered cocktail.

You can not get your Stand 12 drink spiked on the course. They only sell beer and wine, not hard spirits, at the concession stands.  However, you can make this Stand 12 a spiked cocktail to enjoy while watching the Masters live feed from the comfort of your own home.

Fill a clear Masters cup or highball glass 1/2 way with ice. This step helps chill the glass.

Pour the pink lemonade into the glass, filling it about one-third of the way full.

Using the back of a bar spoon, gently pour 4 ounces of your favorite light liquor, such as vodka or rum, on the spoon so it dribbles over the lemonade.

Next, pour a splash of Sprite, about 2 oz, over the liquor you added. You want about an inch of Sprite to go on top of the liquor.

Next, using the back of the bar spoon, slowly pour the blue Powerade on the back of the spoon and then onto the pink lemonade and Sprite layers. Fill the glass almost to the top.

First and foremost, this takes practice to get the perfect layering. Don't give up, keep practicing and enjoy the mess-ups for yourself. üòÖ
