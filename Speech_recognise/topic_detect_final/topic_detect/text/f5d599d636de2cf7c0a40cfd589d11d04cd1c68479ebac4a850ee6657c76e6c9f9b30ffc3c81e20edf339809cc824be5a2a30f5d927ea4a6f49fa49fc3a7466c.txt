Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) organised ‘Iftar’ party at the Islam Gymkhana in Mumbai on April 18. While addressing the occasion, NCP President Sharad Pawar on April 18 said that if the ruling forces ignore the Constitution and law, it will take the nation on the wrong path, hence, it is not right for the nation. He said, “A country runs as per the Constitution and law. If ruling forces inculcate the habit of taking steps by ignoring the Constitution and law, we will go down the wrong path. If taking steps by forgetting law and Constitution and by taking the law into hands is spoken of and if attempts are made to create such an atmosphere, it is not right for the nation.”
