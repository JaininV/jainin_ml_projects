Indian artist Gokul Pillai has created a series of works using AI technology to imagine what some of the world’s wealthiest people might look like if they were poor. His inspiration for this project came from the Hollywood movie “Slumdog Millionaire,” which tells the story of a young man from the slums who becomes rich overnight.

In his works, Pillai highlights the unpredictable nature of financial success, noting that a stroke of luck or misfortune can significantly impact a person’s financial situation. He emphasizes that financial success is not solely based on hard work and determination, but also on luck and timing.

Pillai’s series of works serves as a reminder that anyone, regardless of their current financial situation, can be impacted by unexpected events. The use of AI technology to imagine the wealthy as poor highlights the uncertainty of chance events and the importance of resilience and adaptability.
