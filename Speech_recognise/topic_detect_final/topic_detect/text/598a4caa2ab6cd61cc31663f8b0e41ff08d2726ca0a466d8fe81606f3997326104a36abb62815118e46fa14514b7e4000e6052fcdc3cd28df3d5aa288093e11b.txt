Ford Bronco Raptor's MSRP Has Increased By $15,000 Since It Was Introduced A Year Ago

The Ford Bronco Raptor has received yet another price hike, with the capable off-roader now costing a hefty $83,580 before options or delivery charges have been added. This means the ultimate Bronco is now pricier than its rival from Jeep, the Wrangler Rubicon 392, which justifies its price tag with a more powerful 6.4-liter V8 engine that produces 470 horsepower and 470 lb-ft of torque. The Bronco Raptor was revealed just over a year ago and debuted with a far more palatable starting price of $68,500. If you had ordered a fully-equipped model at the time, you'd have paid just over $80,000. That's slightly less than what a bare-bones model costs right now.A few weeks ago, the Blue Oval increased the MSRP by $2,000. While price adjustments are standard in the auto industry, the Raptor has become $15,000 more expensive in little over a year, which is bizarre.

That means the Bronco Raptor is no longer the off-roading bargain it once was. The range-topper isn't the only model affected, as the Bronco Heritage now commands $46,605 before options and destination charges. When this variant was introduced last year, it carried a base MSRP of $44,305.Regardless of the desired trim level, Bronco customers may have to sacrifice their desired specifications due to supply chain issues. As per the 2023 Bronco configurator, there's limited availability of the entry-level "Base" model and the seven-speed manual transmission option. Production has been put on hold, so the only vehicles you'll find will likely be in dealership inventory.Despite being around for some time, the Bronco has remained one of the most sought-after SUVs on the market, and this has caused a few headaches for the automaker.

The Bronco Raptor isn't the only desirable Ford plagued with price hikes. The all-electric F-150 Lightning Pro (the cheapest model available) now costs $59,974. This most recent increase is the second one in 2023 and one of many since the battery-powered truck was launched.It's shocking to think that the initial base price for the F-150 Lightning was $39,974, which means the same truck is now $20,000 more expensive than before. At the time, a Ford spokesperson said that increasing production costs were to blame. "Pricing adjustments are a normal course of business due to rising material costs, market factors, and ongoing supply chain constraints."Sadly, we expect this trend to continue for a while, and we wouldn't be surprised if Ford's most desirable products receive even more increases this year.
