The Daily Mail’s Sami Mokbel reports that after opening contract talks with Reiss Nelson earlier this year, Arsenal have now made the winger a formal offer of a new deal.

Nelson currently earns around £35,000 a week, and the new deal would be in excess of that. But though his preference is to stay, he’s yet to accept the new contract.

Though negotiations are ongoing, it’s not yet clear whether or not the two parties can reach an agreement.

If not, the Mail report that Aston Villa, Fulham, West Ham United, Brighton, and AC Milan are among the clubs with an interest in a free transfer.

Nelson is settled in London, so it seems a stay at the Emirates Stadium is the ideal scenario. There’s just no consensus on the terms of that stay yet.

It’s likely Nelson’s hesitance is about more than just money, with the player also presumably keen to play more football.

The former England u21 international has made 12 appearances for Arsenal this season, completing 495 minutes on the pitch.

With three goals and three assists, Nelson is averaging a goal contribution every 83 minutes. But he can’t break into the starting lineup ahead of Bukayo Saka or Gabriel Martinelli, so it’s difficult to add to those tallies.

Nelson could still have an important role to play in the remainder of the season, as we saw with his vital goal and assist against Bournemouth in March. After that, he’ll have a decision to make.
