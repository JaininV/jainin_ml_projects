Ninety-eight victims of a 2015 explosion and fire during a party at Formosa Fun Coast (八仙海岸) water park in New Taipei City have been awarded NT$405 million (US$13.25 million) in a civil case against the party’s organizers.

The Shilin District Court yesterday ordered the payout from party organizers Color Play Creative International Co and Ruibo International Integrated Marketing Co and their head, Lu Chung-chi (呂忠吉).

The compensation was less than the NT$2.6 billion sought by the plaintiffs, who were represented by the Consumers’ Foundation.

The foundation said in a statement that it planned to appeal the ruling, citing disappointment with the compensation package and that the water park and its management were not found liable.

The foundation is also leading a NT$7.2 billion class action suit on behalf of 337 other victims of the dust explosion and ensuing fire, which is also being heard at the Shilin District Court.

The cases relate to a blast at the now-defunct Formosa Fun Coast water park on June 27, 2015, when colored cornstarch powder used for party effects exploded and burst into flames, killing 15 people and injuring nearly 500.

Lu was found guilty of professional negligence leading to death in connection to the blast and sentenced to five years in prison, which he began serving in 2019.
