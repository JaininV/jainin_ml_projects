“Last Friday afternoon I learned for the first time about one of these new 11th hour agreements entered into between Disney and the district. This one relates to our utility services,” Garcia said. “We’ll have to evaluate the legality of that agreement, that essentially enables Disney to set their utility rates.  “I’ve never heard of such a thing,” Garcia said.  The board was established to provide state oversight of a special district around Walt Disney World.  DeSantis, a likely Republican presidential candidate who has frequently attacked “woke Disney,” said the company has long operated with an “unfair advantage” in the state through the district.  He has previously complained about an agreement Disney made with outgoing board members to preserve the company’s option to add a fifth major theme park and more retail space and hotel rooms at the resort.

Legislation filed this week would seek to invalidate the agreement.  State Republicans last year began targeting Disney after it publicly clashed with DeSantis over a law that restricts classroom instruction of gender and sexual orientation.  Republicans named the bill the Parental Rights in Education Act, while opponents criticized it as the “Don’t say gay” law.  Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger has called moves to limit Disney’s oversight of its theme parks “anti-business” and “anti-Florida.” (Reporting by Lisa Richwine and Dawn Chmielewski in Los Angeles; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)
