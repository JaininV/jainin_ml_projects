Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, director-general of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) says Nigerians no longer believe that government can do anything for them.

The WTO DG regretted the political class in the country had dashed the hopes of the electorates. “Nigerians have lost trust in government, you know that.

Many Nigerians, especially on our side in the South East, don’t really believe that government can do anything for them. On the one hand, maybe it’s a good thing because everybody then becomes their own government.

You dig your own borehole to get water, generate your own electricity, do everything for yourself. That is entrepreneurial but on the other hand maybe that is not the best way to run things,” she said.

Advocating transparency as the panacea, the WTO boss admonished that for Government to regain its lost confidence among the populace, it “must get a tight, better and cleaner governance that must be transparent”.
