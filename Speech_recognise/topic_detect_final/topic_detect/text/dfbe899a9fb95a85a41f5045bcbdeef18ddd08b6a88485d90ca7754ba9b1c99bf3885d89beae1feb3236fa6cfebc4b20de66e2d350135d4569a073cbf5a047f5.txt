Get To Know Us:

Hi, We’re Misty & Mindy! We are both 10 year old chihuahuas sisters and we weigh around 8 pounds each.

We know this isn’t going to be easy to find us a home together but it’s so very important that we do… you see we are extremely bonded and we have only had each other to lean on. We had the same owners since we were 8 weeks old and at 10 years old we were dumped at the shelter. We can’t even imagine not having each other during this time. It’s been so confusing and scary… we stayed bundled up next to each other until our foster momma came to rescue us. She gave us a safe space in her home to decompress and to take our time to feel confident enough to explore.

We are looking for a home to adopt us both and give us the time needed to feel at home. We adjust but it just takes time, we need a family who has lots of love to give. We love other dogs and like to follow their lead. We haven’t been around cats but we can be tested if needed. A home with younger kids might be to much for us. We need more of a laidback home, we both have laidback personalities and we are just happy having each other. We sleep together, eat together and even follow each other around the yard. Having a fenced in yard is a must for sure. We aren’t the biggest fan of walking on leash, plus we love to explore and sniff the spring flowers.

We are doing great with potty training and we will use a puppy pad if needed. You can crate us if needed, as long as we are crated together we are happy and quiet. Both my sister and I had extremely rotten teeth when coming into rescue. Thanks to your support we were able to have dentals and between us both we lost over 27 teeth! We still like munching on dry food and some yummy treats. Other than that we both are healthy girls and have so many years left to enjoy our new family. We know it’s harder to take us both in but we promise we are worth it. Who would wanna separate us, it just more to love! Please help us find our forever home!
