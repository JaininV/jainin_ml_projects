Drew Barrymore has sparked a debate after admitting that she had not shaved in three months.

The 48-year-old actress shared a hilarious video on Instagram and revealed that she hadn’t shaved her legs for months.

In her video, she seemed to have a stressful Monday morning after the alarm in her apartment suddenly went off while she was in the middle of her shaving session.

Wearing a towel with visible shaving cream under her armpits, she told her followers: “I was finally shaving after three months.”

This comes weeks after Drew said in an InStyle interview that she did not consider shaving as a form of self-care.

“Self-care and I are not friends,” she said. “My legs aren’t shaven. I try to clip my nails down because I don’t like dirt under them. I try to work out three times a week with girlfriends, and I usually make it two days a week, which is something.”

Drew also revealed that she has no time to do it. “Three days a week is the goal,” she expressed. “Sometimes, if I have time, I can do four days a week. It’s just that there’s no time.”

She also described self-care as having her children’s items organized.

“It doesn’t seem like it, but it is, because this f****** bubble bath approach is so irritating,” she said. “That doesn’t bring me self-care or joy. Having my kids’ stuff in a system, lined up, their shoes and their jackets and their backpacks, that makes me feel like I won the morning.”

In her relatable and hilarious clip, the actress revealed: “You can not make this stuff up. I was so excited.  I was finally shaving after three months,” she said.

Many women agreed with the TV host, with one person commenting: “I absolutely hate shaving my legs and only do so when I plan on wearing a skirt/dress, which is to say very rarely. I’m single so it’s not like I have to do it for anyone else’s benefit.”
