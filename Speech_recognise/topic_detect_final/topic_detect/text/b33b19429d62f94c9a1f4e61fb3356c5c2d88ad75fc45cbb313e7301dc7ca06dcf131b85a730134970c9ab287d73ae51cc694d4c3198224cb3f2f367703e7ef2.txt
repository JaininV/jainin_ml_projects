Cohorts are groups of people who have something in common such as age, gender, location, acquisition channel, or when they started doing something or when they became customers of a business.

Cohort analysis is a technique used in analytics and marketing to study the behavior how the different groups of users behave over time, especially in terms of retention, engagement, and revenue. By tracking the performance of each cohort over a period, we can identify trends and patterns that can help us make informed decisions about product development, marketing strategies, and user acquisition.

Cohort analysis is particularly useful for businesses with recurring revenue models, such as subscription-based services or e-commerce sites, as it allows them to monitor the long-term value of their customers and make data-driven decisions to improve retention and profitability.

In Simple, Let’s say you’re running an e-commerce website and you want to analyze the behavior of your customers over time. You decide to group your customers based on the month they made their first purchase (i.e., their acquisition month). Each of these groups represents a cohort.

You can then track the performance of each cohort over time, looking at metrics such as:

* Retention rate: What percentage of customers from each cohort return to make a second purchase, third purchase, and so on?

* Average order value: How much do customers from each cohort spend on average per order?

* Lifetime value: How much revenue do customers from each cohort generate over their lifetime as a customer?

By analyzing these metrics for each cohort, you can identify trends and patterns. For example, you might discover that customers who make their first purchase in November tend to have a higher lifetime value than those who make their first purchase in January. Armed with this knowledge, you can adjust your marketing and retention strategies to target the November cohort more aggressively and improve the lifetime value of future cohorts.

To Explain various use cases, in this blog let us analyse few examples that help to understand this in better.

Let’s say you own a coffee shop and you want to analyze the purchasing behavior of your customers based on their age. You decide to group your customers into four age cohorts: 18–25, 26–35, 36–50, and 51+.

Here’s an example of what the data might look like:

By analyzing this data In this example, we can see that the

36–50 age cohort has the highest average order value, but they visit the coffee shop less frequently than the cohorts 18–25 and 26–35.

18–25 age cohort has the lowest average order value but visits the coffee shop more frequently.

As a Product manager to drive the more Revenues.

we might want to offer discounts or promotions to the 36–50 age cohort to encourage them to visit the coffee shop more often.

We might also want to create more social media content or events that appeal to the 18–25 age cohort to increase their average order value.

Let’s say you run a subscription-based on demand Video Streaming service and you want to analyze the retention rates of your customers based on the plan they chose. You have three plans: Basic, Plus, and Premium.

Here’s an example of what the data might look like:

In this example, we can see that the

Premium plan has the highest retention rates across all cohorts, Basic plan has the lowest retention rates. The retention rates for all plans tend to decline over time.

By analyzing this data, we can identify which plans are most likely to retain customers over time and adjust our pricing and retention strategies accordingly. For example,

we might want to increase the benefits or services offered with the Basic plan to improve its retention rates, or consider introducing a new mid-tier plan to bridge the gap between the Basic and Plus plans. We might also want to focus our marketing efforts on the Premium plan to attract more customers to that plan.

Let’s say you run an e-commerce website and you want to analyze the purchasing behavior of your customers based on the month they made their first purchase. You group your customers into six monthly cohorts: Jan 2021, Feb 2021, Mar 2021, Apr 2021, May 2021, and Jun 2021.

In this example, we can see that the average order value and total revenue are consistent across all monthly cohorts, but the repeat purchase rate increases over time.

By analyzing this data, we can identify which monthly cohorts are most likely to make repeat purchases and adjust our marketing and sales strategies accordingly. For example, we might want to offer

loyalty programs or discounts to customers in the early monthly cohorts to encourage them to make repeat purchases.

We might also want to focus our advertising efforts on the more recent monthly cohorts, as they have higher repeat purchase rates and are more likely to generate long-term revenue for our business.

In conclusion, cohort analysis is a simple and powerful tool for businesses to understand their customers and improve their products or services. By dividing customers into groups based on a common characteristic and analyzing their behavior over time, businesses can learn valuable insights about what makes customers loyal and what might cause them to leave. With this information, businesses can make informed decisions to improve their offerings and keep customers happy.
