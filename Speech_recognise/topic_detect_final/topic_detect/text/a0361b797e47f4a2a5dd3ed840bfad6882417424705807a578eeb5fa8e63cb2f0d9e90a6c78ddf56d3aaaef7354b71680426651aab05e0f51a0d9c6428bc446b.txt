This is a first from RYL! A male spaceform anime skin. This space dude is made to fit any Bakes on Mesh male body of your choosing! Guys you still have time to get this before the SciFi Con will close (April 14th). If not, he’s moving to the RYL store soon after.  And, in these latter days of the SciFi Con, you can enjoy the sights with the much smaller crowds too!

Yes, take a quick trip over to the RYL booth at Sci Fi Con and grab him today! I am wearing him on the Signature Gianni but any Bakes on Mesh body could handle this skin. There are both the EVO X heads, ears and neck layers too, and one for the Classic SL heads.

Included are also the RYL Spaceform Male Shorts (in White Only) with the option of an Extra Hud with two more colors for the briefs. These fit the ADAM, Altamura, EXMACHINA, Geralt and Gianni, Belleza Jake, Legacy and Slink male bodies. So plenty in there to cover lots of the male mesh bodies out there!

This is the RYL GIFT at the SCIFI Con this year. A simple leg tattoo to decorate your body. It matches the skin perfectly! Don’t forget to grab that one! It comes in a BOM layer and Omega applier is included.

Here is your ride to the RYL SciFi Con booth! Each purchase of the skin and the Deluxe Hud for the shorts is a donation that goes to Relay for Life for American Cancer Society Research to find a cure for cancer!
