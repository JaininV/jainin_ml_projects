Munster have confirmed that Springbok lock RG Snyman is unavailable for selection for Saturday’s URC clash against the Sharks in Durban.

Snyman has had his fair share of injury struggles in recent years, but made a successful return to play in March and starred in Munster’s epic win over the Stormers at Cape Town Stadium on this past Saturday.

But Snyman’s herculean performance came at a cost as it has now been confirmed that he will sit out Munster’s last regular season game against the Sharks this coming weekend.

According to the official Munster website, the gigantic lock suffered a head injury against the Stormers and will follow the return to play protocols this week, rendering him unavailable for Saturday’s game.

Munster are currently fourth in the United Rugby Championship standings with one round of regular season fixtures remaining, meaning they are assured of a place in the playoffs.
