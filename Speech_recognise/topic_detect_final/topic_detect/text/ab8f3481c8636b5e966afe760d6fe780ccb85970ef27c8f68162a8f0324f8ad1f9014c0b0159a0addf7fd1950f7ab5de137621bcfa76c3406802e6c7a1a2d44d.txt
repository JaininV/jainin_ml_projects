Danish logistics group Blue Water Shipping has taken full ownership of its wind turbine services venture, buying out its fellow partner Danwind for an undisclosed sum.

After operating as a joint venture for a year and a half, Danwind Blue Water, which offers turnkey services covering the full scope of logistics, assembly, disassembly and installation of wind turbines, will become fully integrated under the Blue Water brand.

Blue Water has been a leading provider of transport and logistics solutions to the global wind market for many years. The company recently signed a five-year deal with turbine maker Vestas for the handling of wind components in the ports of Esbjerg and Cuxhaven. Taking over from Danwind will now see Blue Water bolster its offering within the installation and maintenance segment, both onshore and offshore.

“The full ownership gives us better opportunities to continue expanding and developing our service to the wind industry, to which we have delivered transport and logistics for over 25 years. We are known for our efficient solutions of high quality and a high service level. We see good opportunities to grow further in this segment based on these virtues,” said Thomas Bek, Blue Water Shipping’s COO of energy, ports and project division.
