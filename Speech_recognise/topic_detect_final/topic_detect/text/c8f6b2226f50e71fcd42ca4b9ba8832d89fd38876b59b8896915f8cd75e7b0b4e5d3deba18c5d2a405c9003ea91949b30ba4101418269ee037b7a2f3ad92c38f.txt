Giving us an excuse to blast our favourite R&B noughties playlist (not that not having one ever stopped us before) is the news that nostalgia-inducing music festival Juicy Fest is returning to Australia in 2024. The banger-filled event is bringing along hip-hop and R&B icons like Ashanti, T-Pain, The Game and many more familiar faces to the Gold Coast in January.

If you’re guilty of trying to replicate Ashanti’s sweet vocals when ‘Foolish’ plays on the radio, you’ve got down and dirty in the clubs to the auto-tuned masterpiece that is ‘Buy U a Drank’ or you’ve jammed way too many times to ‘Hate It Or Love It’, then this is your sign to buy a ticket to 2000s-inspired hip-hop and R&B festival Juicy Fest. The 2024 edition of Juicy Fest, which is coming to Doug Jennings Park on the Gold Coast on Saturday January 20, will be headlined by a clutch of hip-hop and R&B legends including T-Pain, Ashanti, T. I. and The Game. The line-up also features 90s and 2000s superstars like Trey Songz, Fabolous, Bone Thugs N Harmony, Keri Hilson and Mario.

Following a dynamite debut in 2023, the 18-plus festival is scheduled for nine shows across New Zealand and Australia in January. The Gold Coast will be the last stop on the tour, so you know your favourite artists are going to put on one hell of a show. You can pre-register for Juicy Fest tickets right now via The Ticket Fairy website, with general admission tickets priced at $199. Tickets go on sale to the general public from Wednesday April 26 at 7:00 pm local time. Until Ashanti is ready to ‘Rock Wit U’, pop on your favourite R&B Spotify playlist to get you through.
