Skip buying ranch seasoning packets from the store. It’s so easy to make your own flavorful Homemade Ranch Seasoning Mix at home.

This seasoning mix has a bold flavor. It’s great for making creamy dips and dressings. It also makes a wonderful seasoning for chicken, potatoes, and so much more!

Ranch dressing is a favorite at my house and homemade is so much better than bottled dressing. We use homemade Ranch dressing on salads and as a dipping sauce so I always have it on hand.

This is the easiest mix to put together. Measure all the ingredients.

Once you have all of your spices measured out, combine all ingredients in a bowl and mix well. Store in an airtight container.

* The dried green spices tend to separate from the rest of the ingredients. That’s ok, just give it a good stir before using it each time.

* Use just like the store-bought seasoning ranch packets.

* Adjust to your own taste. That’s the best thing about making your own. Want more chives? Throw them in there! Want a little less garlic powder, no problem, adjust it down a bit. In other words, adjust it to meet your perfect preferences.

* Be sure to store the mix in an airtight container in a cool, dry area such as a pantry.
