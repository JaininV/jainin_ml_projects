Final Fantasy 16’s Collector’s Edition is pretty cool – it’s also completely sold out. Including a statue of the giant titan-like Eikons Ifrit and Phoenix, as well as a set of pins, a steelbook case, and a cloth map, the entire bundle retails for £329.99/$349.99. While you can join a waiting list on Square Enix’s online store to get notified when more become available, it’s likely this limited edition is now long gone.

Which makes it a perfect opportunity for scalpers. eBay listings are already appearing selling the item at double its MSRP, with some being bold enough to demand up to £999.99. It’s unlikely anyone will actually pay these wild fees – especially when the resellers don’t even have the stock in hand yet – but it just shows how frustrating these limited time items can be. Square Enix has been particularly egregious with the availability of this stuff: pre-orders for the Anniversary Edition of the Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster are also being flogged for way over $1,200 right now.

All in all, you’re going to have to be pretty desperate (and rich) to cough this kind of cash up. If you didn’t get a pre-order for Final Fantasy 16’s Collector’s Edition, we’d recommend just forgetting it exists and moving on with your life. Yes, that steelbook and statue would look great on your shelf – but do you really need it? Not for over double its MSRP you don’t!
