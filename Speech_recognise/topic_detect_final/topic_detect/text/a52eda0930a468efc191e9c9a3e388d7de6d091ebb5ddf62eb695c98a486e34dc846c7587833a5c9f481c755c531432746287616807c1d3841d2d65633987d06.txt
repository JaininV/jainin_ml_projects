COLUMBUS, Ohio (News Talk 1480 WHBC and ONN) â€“ CEO of Norfolk Southern Railway Alan Shaw testified for the first time before a State Senate committee Tuesday.

He talked of the progress being made at the train derailment site, saying soil removal work is done under the southbound tracks.

Now the tracks are back in place and trains rolling again.

Now that the company has confirmed that the new track is stable, the plan starting Wednesday is to remove the northbound tracks in the same area to remove more contaminated soil.
