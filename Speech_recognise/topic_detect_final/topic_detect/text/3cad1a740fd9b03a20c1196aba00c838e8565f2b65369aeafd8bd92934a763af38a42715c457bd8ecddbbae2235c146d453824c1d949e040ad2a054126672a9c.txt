Read the “Two girlfriend“ joke of the day!

Laughter is the best medicine, and South Africans could certainly do with a dose of the giggles these days!

A man came through my lane at the grocery store with a jug of wine and a bouquet of roses.

But before paying, he set the two items aside and said, “I’ll be right back.”

He ran off, only to ­return a minute later with a second jug of wine and another bouquet of roses.

“No,” he said. “Just one really angry one.”
