Southampton have reportedly set the asking price for their in-demand captain James Ward-Prowse, who they are ready to sell this summer.

The Saints, who are increasingly likely to get relegated to the Championship this season, are already preparing themselves for life without their influential captain and would like to get the most out of him.

They currently sit bottom of the table, having picked up just 23 points from 31 games and are four points from safety, having won just one of their last eight league games.

According to reports by 90min, the Saints will have to sell some key players – including Kyle Walker-Peters, Mohammed Salisu, Armel Bella-Kotchap and Romeo Lavia –  if they go down.

England international and set-piece specialist Ward-Prowse is also prepared to part ways with the club he has represented since the age of eight.

As per the report, Southampton will demand around £50m for Ward-Prowse, who is the subject of interest from several Premier League sides.

Newcastle United manager Eddie Howe and the club’s sporting director Dan Ashworth are huge fans of the Southampton man. The top-four-chasing Magpies are being informed of the player’s developing situation on the south coast, though their summer business hinges on their final position in the standings.

Manchester United also believe that Ward-Prowse could add some creativity in their midfield,  while Tottenham, Liverpool and Aston Villa are also admirers of the 28-year-old.

Ward-Prowse is one goal from a direct free-kick away from tying David Beckham’s Premier League record of 18.

The 28-year-old has scored seven goals and provided two assists in 31 league games for Southampton this season.
