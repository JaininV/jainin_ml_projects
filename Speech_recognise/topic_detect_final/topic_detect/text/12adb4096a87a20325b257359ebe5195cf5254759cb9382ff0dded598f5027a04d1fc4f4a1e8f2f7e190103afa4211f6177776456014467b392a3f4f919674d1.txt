The leadership of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Kashere Ward of Akko local government area of Gombe State has expelled the Senator representing Gombe Central in the National Assembly, Danjuma Goje, over alleged anti-party activities during the 2023 elections. The APC Ward chairman, Tanimu Abdullahi, announced the unanimous decision to expel Goje after a panel was constituted to probe the allegations.

Abdullahi cited several anti-party activities that led to the expulsion, including Gojeâ€™s failure to attend APC campaign rallies, boycotting all campaign tours in his Central senatorial zone, and openly supporting opposition party candidates. According to Abdullahi, Goje hosted the NNPP gubernatorial candidate and the PDP Akko Federal House of Representatives candidate in his residence and offered support against the interest of his party, the APC.

Furthermore, Goje was accused of making pronouncements that undermined the APC administration in the state and sponsoring campaigns of calumny with the intention of inciting the public against the APC administration. He also gave clear directives to his associates and proteges to work against the interest of the APC in Gombe State by ensuring only Senator Goje is elected on the APC platform while working towards the defeat of other APC candidates at all levels.

The executive council of the All Progressives Congress in Kashere ward took the decision to expel Senator Danjuma Goje from the All Progressives Congress for his numerous anti-party activities that are in breach of Article 21, Section A, subsections ii, iii, vi and vii of the APC constitution.

The expulsion of Senator Goje is a significant development in the political landscape of Gombe State, as he was a former governor of the State and a prominent figure in the APC. This move by the APC leadership in Kashere Ward is expected to send a strong message to other party members and discourage anti-party activities that can undermine the success of the party in future elections
