The Sport and Recreation Commission (SRC) has ordered the postponed the highly anticipated tie between Dynamos and Highlanders in the Zimbabwe Castle Lager Premier Soccer League.

The news was confirmed by the league’s Communications and Media Liaison Officer Kudzai Bare.

“This comes following a directive from the Sports and Recreation Commission for the teams to participate in the Independence Day activities which will commence on the 16th of April 2023,” said Bare in a press statement.

The match, dubbed the ‘Battle of Zimbabwe’ was set for this Saturday 15 April 2023 at Barbourfields, It was also pencilled in as one of the games to be broadcast.

ZTN will now be scurrying around to find something with which to replace it..

No revised date was announced, with it to be provided ‘in due course’.

This says more about the fact that the League seems to figure some of these things week by week. Whatever had been planned by now inasfar as clubs and so forth could have been less inconvenienced if the fixtures and dates were clearer, and not a situation where the league advises the public of match times and dates on the week of the matches.

All other matches this weekend will happen as planned and you can check out the fixtures here.
