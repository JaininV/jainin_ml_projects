Are you tired of the same old boring breakfast routine? Spice things up with Shakshuka, a vibrant and delicious dish that has become a staple of Middle Eastern and Mediterranean cuisine. Picture this: a bubbling, spicy, garlicky tomato sauce with perfectly poached eggs nestled on top, all waiting to be devoured with warm, crusty bread or pita.

If you follow me on Instagram, you may have caught a glimpse of my recent trip to Israel, where I had the pleasure of tasting a wide variety of delicious dishes. I’m thrilled to share the favorites that have inspired my recent recipe creations.

The first recipe I shared after this trip was my quicker version of Mujadara— a delicious lentils, rice, and onion dish. And today, it’s all about a new favorite breakfast recipe: Shakshuka! We had Shakshuka quite a few times on the trip and I could not get enough of it!

Shakshuka is a popular breakfast dish made by simmering a flavorful tomato sauce with spices and poaching eggs directly in the sauce. The dish is often served with crusty bread or warm pita for dipping.

Shakshuka is traditionally served with warm, crusty bread or pita. However, you can also pair it with a variety of other side toppings such as avocado, feta cheese, or a simple salad.

To truly enjoy this dish to its full potential, you simply must warm up your bread of choice, whether it’s a good crusty baguette or charred pita.

To warm up a crusty baguette, preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Wrap the bread in foil and place it in the oven for about 10-15 minutes. Alternatively, you can slice the bread and toast it in a toaster.

To heat pita bread, warm a cast-iron skillet or griddle over medium-high heat. Once hot, place the pita bread in the skillet and cook for about 30-45 seconds on each side until slightly charred and warmed up. Watch carefully to not overcook or burn. Alternatively, char on the stovetop over an open flame by spraying both sides of the pita with olive oil cooking spray and “grilling” over medium heat until slightly charred, about 10-15 seconds per side (flip with tongs).

Serve Shakshuka in the skillet or pan it was cooked in and enjoy it directly from the dish with bread or pita on the side for dipping.

While you certainly can use a fork or spoon, traditional serving uses bread or pita as a serving utensil.

* Olive oil: Don’t skimp here! We need the oil to sauté the onion and pepper and to provide richness and flavor to the dish.

* Red onion and roasted red pepper: These veggies provide a sweet and slightly sharp, smoky flavor to the dish. You’ll find roasted red peppers near jarred pickles, artichoke hearts, and capers.

* Tomato paste: Paste delivers a more concentrated tomato flavor while keeping the sauce from being too watery.

* Spices: Ground cumin, paprika, and red pepper flakes bring depth, complexity, and vibrancy to this dish. Use smoked paprika for a smokier flavor. Feel free to increase or decrease the amount of red pepper flakes to personal spice preference.

* Crushed tomatoes: I recommend the best quality tomatoes you can find since these really form the flavor base of this dish–the better the tomatoes, the better the flavor! If you can find fire-roasted crushed tomatoes, even better.

* Eggs: Eggs top the dish and provide protein, richness, and a creamy texture when cooked.

* Optional fresh parsley or cilantro: This is not just a garnish; it also adds freshness and color.
