I’ve been waiting for this moment since last fall. Here in Michigan, it’s actually getting up to almost 80 degrees- and it is likely hit the big 8-0 in many parts of the state. We’re just in April, so these are record highs. I’m loving it, but I realize the unseasonably warm temperatures can cause problems, especially since we haven’t had much rain.

Wednesday (April 12), the National Weather Service predicts temperatures to get up near 80 in much of lower Michigan. While temperatures will be high, it will also be breezy, with west winds at 10 to 20 miles per hour. Thursday (April 13), expect more sun and even warmer temperatures, with highs likely to get into the 80s. Do I need to get out my bikini already? Locally, in Detroit, temperatures are expected to hit the 80s as early as Wednesday and stay there the rest of the week. In Grand Rapids and Lansing, don’t expect temperatures to hit the 80-degree mark until Thursday. Friday (April 14) is also projected to get into the 80s.

Also, according to the National Weather Service, there is a danger of fires today. They tweeted out, “Warm, dry air and gusty winds will result in a higher chance of fires quickly spreading out of control. Today, temperatures will climb into the upper 70s in many locations, though will be cooler right near Lake Michigan.” Much of the west side of the state, including Grand Rapids, Kalamazoo and even as east as Lansing, is under a Red Flag (Fire Weather) Warning.

The weekend will start warm, and then temperatures are expected to drop to the 50s or 60s when rain hits. Thank goodness we’re getting rain, because we need it.
