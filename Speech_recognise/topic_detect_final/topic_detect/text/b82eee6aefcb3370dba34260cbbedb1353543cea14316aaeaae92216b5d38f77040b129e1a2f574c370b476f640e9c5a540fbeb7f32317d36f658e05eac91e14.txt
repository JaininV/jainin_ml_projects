Xiaomi has officially announced that its new flagship will launch on April 18, we’re talking about the Xiaomi 13 Ultra, of course. That date was mentioned recently by a Chinese retailer, and it turns out that info is true.

Do note that this is not just a China launch, though. The phone will launch both in China and globally on April 18. Xiaomi’s CEO is sticking to its promise from last year, the Xiaomi 13 Ultra will be available outside of China.
