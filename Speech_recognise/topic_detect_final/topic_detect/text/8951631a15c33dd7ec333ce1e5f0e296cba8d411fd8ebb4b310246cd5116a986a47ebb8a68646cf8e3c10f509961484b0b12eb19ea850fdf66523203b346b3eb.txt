Cody Rhodes gave his all during WrestleMania Sunday’s main event match, but he came up short. After he laid on the mat for a while, next to a rubber chicken, Cody Rhodes took a little bit of time off.

WWE wrote a Brock Lesnar beat down angle for Cody Rhodes on the RAW after WrestleMania. That segment called for the American Nightmare to get a little bit of time off from the ring.

Cody Rhodes was there when WWE rolled through Rio Rancho, New Mexico. Fans at the live event were happy to see Cody Rhodes open the show, but then he had bad news for them. Cody said that he wasn’t cleared to compete. Then Imperium came out and beat him up, to set up a match later on in the night.

Kevin Owens and Matt Riddle came to Cody’s rescue during that opening segment. To settle the score, a six-man tag team match was scheduled for the main event, where the good guys emerged victorious.

We’ll have to see what’s next for Cody Rhodes in WWE. He is obviously a huge babyface, and now Matt Riddle is in the mix as well. Keep checking back with Ringside News for more on this story, and everything else in the pro wrestling world!
