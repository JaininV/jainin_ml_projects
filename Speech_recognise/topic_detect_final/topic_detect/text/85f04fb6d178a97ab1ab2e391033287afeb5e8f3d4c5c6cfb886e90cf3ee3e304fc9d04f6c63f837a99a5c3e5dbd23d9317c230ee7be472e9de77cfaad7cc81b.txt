In this activity you will provide a communication plan in response to a patient and family scenario. How would you communicate caring and respond to the patient, family, and the interdisciplinary team taking care of this patient and family?

Mr. Richards is an 89-year-old man who has come into the intensive care unit after suffering an acute stroke with resulting aphasia. His son Jason came to visit him for the first time in five years from Montana and noticed his mumbled, garbled speech, drooping eye, and lip. Mr. Richards is the proud father of five children, all of whom are married, and a grandfather of 10. Some of these grandchildren are old enough to have spouses of their own. Unfortunately, Mr. Richards’s wife died last year, and his care was transferred to his eldest daughter, Melissa, for the past six months.

The relationship between Melissa and her siblings is complicated, and all of them have insisted on obtaining a security code for themselves to access information about Mr. Richards’s condition. Melissa, not wanting to start an argument, has given it to her brothers and sisters, who, in turn, gave it to a few grandchildren. Melissa tells you that her father has not spoken to two of the siblings since the death of his wife due to “issues in settling her will and last wishes.” Melissa reports to the nurses that Jason is feeling guilty that he has not been more involved in the past five years. Jason refused to attend his mother’s funeral last year but produced a list of items he wanted sent to him from her belongings. Melissa also warns you her dad was well respected and attended a local church, whose parishioners have been pressuring her for information. One parish nurse in particular, Patty, has been known to call and visit the hospital during past hospitalizations of Mr. and Mrs. Richards, seeking information about their condition.

Every day on the unit, the nurse assigned to Mr. Richards receives at least eight phone calls about his status from a variety of relatives and friends. Although the nurse tries to be concise, often the conversations with family can take up to 30 minutes, as the nurse has to explain several times and in detail medical issues the patient is having. After a few days of this, the care team brings the family together for a care conference and explains the difficulties in handling so many calls when their father’s care is so critical.

As an end result of the meeting, it was decided that all information will flow through Melissa, and visitation will be restricted to only Melissa, although this does not make everyone happy. The plan is agreed to, however, and now the nurses will field one update call per shift to Melissa and continue to care for and communicate with Mr. Richards.

What is your communication plan for today when you take on the patient and family in this case?

How do you respond and communicate with the following?

* Jason when he calls at 0930

* Melissa when she visits at 1100

* Patty when she visits the unit on “patient rounds”

* Jason’s son Kirk who requests to visit at 1300
