RB|ApologyMan happened to run into Ryota Niitsuma at Evo Japan 2023. Though Niitsuma is no longer with Capcom anymore, Niitsuma once worked as the Producer of Marvel vs. Capcom 3 and Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 during his time working at Capcom.

Thanks to some help from Ho-chan for translating, this proved to be the perfect opportunity to conduct an impromptu interview. As such, ApologyMan has released a video that showcases the entire session with Niitsuma.

At one point during the interview, ApologyMan asked Niitsuma how is it that Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 was able to succeed in becoming the type of fighting game that allows for creative gameplay whereas other fighters tend to be more "rigid" in how they play.

According to Niitsuma through Ho-chan's translation, "with Marvel vs. Capcom 2 and Marvel vs. Capcom 3, they were trying to make something that was basically the opposite of Street Fighter." Essentially, anything that couldn't be done in the Street Fighter series should be possible in the Marvel vs. Capcom series.

Essentially, the Marvel vs. Capcom series is intentionally designed to be far more chaotic in its nature compared to other fighting games such as those found in the Street Fighter series. There's less of a need to "stick to the standard fighting game rules" with Marvel vs. Capcom.
