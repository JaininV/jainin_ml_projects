Local fashion designer Jakob Carter has opened a new brick-and-mortar store in the hub of shopping for Auckland, Newmarket.

Originally from the East Coast town of Opotiki, Carter is living his dream and is set to open his flagship store on Newmarket’s main street, Broadway St.

Carter’s opening of his store will showcase his brand of fashion styles and fragrances.

“Street shopping has a sense of style. It’s a feeling you get as you wander the streets with a coffee in hand,” says Carter, explaining why he chose a street brick-and-mortar.

“I’ve chosen this area because I love the vibe and energy within Newmarket. I’m so excited to open our flagship store here and I look forward to working alongside some incredible brands.”

He adds that he personally loves the idea of street shopping on a sunny day compared to a mall with hundreds of people which is what motivated him to open a store on Broadway St.

Known for his perfume collection in collaboration with Stan Walker, Carter says another celebrity fragrance is in the works.

Alongside the fragrance collection, Carter will be showcasing his winter collection in time for the colder weather.

“I am going to really shake things up with the next collection and push the boundaries of design and this will be my most iconic collection yet,” he says.

Stocked in over 300 stores, the Newmarket store will be his first flagship store in New Zealand.
