From 1 July 2023, your self-managed super fund (SMSF) must report certain events that affect your members transfer balance account quarterly. You report these events by lodging a transfer balance account report (TBAR) no later than 28 days after the end of the quarter in which they occur.

This change will provide your members with more timely and accurate information which allows them to make informed decisions in managing their transfer balance account and cap.

If you're currently lodging the TBAR annually at the same time as your SMSF annual return, you will need to report all events that occurred in the 2023 income year by 28 October 2023.

You should start lodging quarterly now to save time at the end of the income year.

The easiest way to lodge is online through Online services for business. Your tax agent can also lodge online through their online services.
