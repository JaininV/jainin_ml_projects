Yesterday, we shared Oppa Park Sihoo-ssi’s past, his past works, that is. I hope you, especially his new fans, now have a better appreciation of some of his brilliant works.

Today, we will talk about ourselves, our website ParkSihooSsi.com and our work. Our dedicated website has been set up so that international fans can gather together to love and support our favorite actor Park Sihoo-ssi.

The website has been incepted in 2015 and since then, we have been supporting our Oppa Park Sihoo-ssi every step of the way. Whether he is active and in the limelight or keeping a low profile away from maddening eyes.

And may I say that as I look back on the past, I see us improving over the years in our presentation and our work. But one thing is really important and evident.  Our momentum is aligned with our Oppa. When he thrives, we thrive too. When he is active, we are too. The energy and synergy between us is always in tandem. The unbreakable bonding.

To recapture our moments, year-on-year…here is glimpse of our past – our work…

Start of a fresh new chapter in 2019
