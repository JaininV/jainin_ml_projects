This year's Outfest Fusion Film Festival's one-minute move category tasked filmmakers with telling a story of queer joy in 60 seconds or less. Director Nasir Kenneth Ferebee (a Black gay filmmaker who also served as the producer of All Boys Aren't Blue) answered the call with Your Love Is King.

Ferebee's Your Love Is King follows a Black gay couple as they recover in the wake of their first major disagreement. Actors Nigel Cox and Jermell DeShaun put on stunning performances that capture the multifaceted essence of Black queer love and joy.

Despite having no spoken dialogue, the film says so much across its 60 second run time, imparting a beautiful message and showcasing the tenderness of love between two Black men. It is no surprise the film was chosen as an official selection for Outfest Fusion.

Your Love Is King is a heartwarming and powerful testament to the beauty of Black gay love, intimacy, and joy, and a must watch for 2023.
