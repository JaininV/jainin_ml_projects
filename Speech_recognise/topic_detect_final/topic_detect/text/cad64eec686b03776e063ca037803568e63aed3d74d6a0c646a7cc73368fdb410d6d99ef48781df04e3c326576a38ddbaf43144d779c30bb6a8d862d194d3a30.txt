A Butler County resident has entered a guilty plea to federal charges connected to the embezzlement of a large amount of money from a Pittsburgh company.

According to the United States Department of Justice, 57-year-old Constance Stobert of Renfrew pled guilty to 11 counts of wire fraud and making false statements on tax returns.

While working as a controller for Mechanical Operations Company, Stobert is accused of embezzling nearly $1.7 million between January of 2014 and July of 2018 to fund her gambling habit and pay for personal expenses. She then did not report the money she embezzled as income on her tax returns leading to an investigation by the IRS and FBI.

Stobert is facing a maximum sentence of decades in prison, millions in fines, or both when she is scheduled to be sentenced in September.
