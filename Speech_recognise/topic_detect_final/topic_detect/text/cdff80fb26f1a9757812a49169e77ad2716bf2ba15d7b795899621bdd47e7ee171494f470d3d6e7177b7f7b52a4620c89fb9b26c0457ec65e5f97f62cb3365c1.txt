A Mubadala Investment Co.-backed healthcare company is nearing a deal to acquire kidney-care provider Diaverum for more than $2 billion including debt, according to people familiar with the matter, extending the Abu Dhabi sovereign-wealth fund’s bet on healthcare.

M42, a newly launched healthcare operator owned by Mubadala and a partner company, G42, is planning to acquire Diaverum from U. K.-based buyout firm Bridgepoint Group PLC. A deal is expected to be announced later this week, assuming talks don’t break down, the people said.
