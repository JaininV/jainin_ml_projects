Rhino Bucket have announced a major change as long-time bassist Reeve Downes is no longer in the band and will be getting replaced by Sean McNabb (Dokken, Great White, XYZ, Quiet Riot, Burning Rain, Rough Cutt, Lynch Mob) who will be rounding out the line-up consisting of frontman Georg Dolivo, guitarist Brian Forsythe (KIX) and drummer Dave DuCey. Downes had been in Rhino Bucket since their inception back in 1986.

The following message was posted on Georg Dolivo‘s Facebook page yesterday (with slight edits):

“So, enough about the toaster (if you know, you know).

The new line up of Rhino Bucket is:

We will be playing the MORC with the incredible Greg Smith and then resume to carry on and start giving the States the same attention we give Europe. It was time.

So, welcome Sean to the band and look out for us in the future!
