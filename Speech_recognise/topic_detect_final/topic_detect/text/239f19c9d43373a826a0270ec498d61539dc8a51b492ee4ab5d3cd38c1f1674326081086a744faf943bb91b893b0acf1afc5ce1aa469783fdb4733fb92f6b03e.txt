A registered sex offender is behind bars after Allegheny County Police said he used a popular social media app to interact with a 13-year-old girl, according to Tribune-Review news partner WPXI-TV.

A criminal complaint filed in the case said Jerrell Carson, 28, posed as a 15-year-old on Snapchat and began communicating with the teen. The interactions led to a sexual relationship, police said.

Carson admitted to police that he visited the girl at a home in Wilkins and they engaged in sexual activity on multiple occasions, the complaint said.

A registered sex offender since 2015, Carson faces charges including corruption of a minor and sexual assault.

Police said the alleged victim’s aunt discovered Carson on the Megan’s Law website database of registered sex offenders, assisting police in the investigation.

Allegheny County Police said there is greater potential for these types of crimes as online social media make it easier for sexual predators to have access to minors.

“Parents sometimes think the gaming applications are OK, but if they have a chat window, a lot of predators will lure children in that way and pose as children and eventually will get them onto an app with direct contact with text message and a phone,” said Allegheny County Police Lt. Jason Binder.
