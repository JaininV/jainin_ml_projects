Nabrawind said the funding agreement with FFI, which is convertible into a minority shareholding, would help expand its capacity to meet growing demand for renewable energy projects.

“Reducing the cost of renewable energy production is a key driver of green hydrogen adoption. The innovative products developed by the talented team at Nabrawind are just one of the ways to do this, both for FFI and across the market,” said Mark Hutchinson, CEO of FFI.

Nabrawind is developing several innovative technologies it claims will improve efficiency in the wind industry.

Among them is the company’s patented top-down turbine installation system called Skylift, which Nabrawind says can operate in high wind speeds of up to 15m/s and install a typical 120-metre turbine tower in 3-4 days.

Nabrawind also developed a segmented turbine blade system called Nabrajoint designed to make transportation of the components easier.
