According to the Daily Mail, Disneyland unveiled an LGBT-friendly ‘Pride Nite’ event in June after Florida Governor Ron DeSantis escalated his battle against the progressive entertainment giant.

The $119-a-ticket party was announced on Twitter Monday afternoon, just moments after a press conference in which DeSantis threatened to build a state prison next to Walt Disney World and Reedy Creek.

That move was in retaliation after the entertainment giant attempted to circumvent the authority of his oversight board. Disney found itself in DeSantis’ sights last year after ousted CEO Bob Chapek slammed Florida’s Parental Rights in Education Bill – better known as the ‘Don’t Say Gay’ law.

According to Disney, characters like Mickey and Minnie Mouse will wear special rainbow costumes at the event to celebrate everything LGBTQ.

Pride Nite will take place in Disney’s original Anaheim theme park in liberal California, thousands of miles away from its huge Orlando resort which is in DeSantis’ sights.
