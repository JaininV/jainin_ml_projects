Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), also referred to as clinical depression, is a significant medical condition that can affect many areas of your life. It impacts mood and behavior as well as various physical functions, such as appetite and sleep. The exact cause of MDD isn’t known. However, there are several factors that can increase the risk of developing the condition.

* In August 2022, Relmada Therapeutics announced the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Fast Track designation to REL-1017 (esmethadone) as a monotherapy for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). REL-1017 is a novel N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) channel blocker. The investigational treatment is administered orally once daily and is designed to target hyperactive GluN1-GluN2D NMDAR channels while maintaining physiological glutamatergic neurotransmission.

* In June 2022, Cybin received FDA IND Clearance for its Phase I/IIa clinical trial evaluating CYB003 for the potential treatment of Major Depressive Disorder.

* In June 2022,  Biogen and Sage Therapeutics announced that the Phase III SKYLARK Study of zuranolone, an investigational oral drug being evaluated in women with postpartum depression (PPD), met its primary and all key secondary endpoints. Women treated with zuranolone 50 mg (n=98) demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in depressive symptoms at Day 15, the primary endpoint, compared to placebo (n=97) as measured by a change from baseline (CFB) in the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD-17) total score.

* In October 2021, Small Pharma granted Fast-Track Designation from the UK regulator for SPL026 DMT-Assisted therapy for Major Depressive Disorder.

* In October 2021, Chase Therapeutics announced $20 million Series B financing to advance clinical trials in parkinson’s disease and Major Depressive Disorder. The proceeds of the Series B will support Phase 3 pivotal trials for CTC-501 for the treatment of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and CTC-413 for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease (PD) as well as completion of the development and validation of a diagnostic product for Parkinson’s Disease.

SAGE-217 is an investigational, oral, novel medicine in development for depression. SAGE-217 is an investigational oral neuroactive steroid (NAS) GABAA receptor positive allosteric modulator (PAM). The GABA system is the major inhibitory signaling pathway of the brain and central nervous system (CNS), and contributes significantly to regulating CNS function. Biogen and Sage Therapeutics have submitted a new drug application (NDA) to the FDA for zuranolone for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD).

REL-1017, an NCE and novel NMDAR channel blocker with a preference for hyperactive channels associated with MDD. The U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Fast Track designation for REL-1017 as an adjunctive treatment of MDD. REL-1017, has entered its Phase 3 registration program as an adjunctive treatment for MDD.

Seltorexant is an innovative selective orexin 2 receptor antagonist under development for the treatment of insomnia and related mood disorders. Insomnia is the repeated difficulty with sleep initiation, maintenance or quality that occurs despite adequate time and opportunity for sleep, resulting in daytime impairment. The clinical trials are being carried out for the treatment of major depressive disorder in phase III stage of development.

SP-624 is being studied in phase II stage of development for the treatment of major depressive disorder in comparison with placebo by Sirtsei Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

SPL026 (DMT), is a naturally occurring psychedelic tryptamine found in plants and in the brain of mammals. Scientific evidence suggests DMT offers the potential for rapid-acting and long-lasting antidepressant effects. DMT is differentiated by its short psychedelic experience (< 30mins), which allows for short treatment sessions and offers the potential for convenient supervised treatments within patient clinics. Small Pharma is advancing a pipeline of DMT-based therapies and is leading the world’s first DMT clinical trial for depression, in collaboration with Imperial College London.

PDC-1421 (BLI-1005) is a Norepinephrine plasma membrane transport protein inhibitor being developed by BioLite Inc, for the treatment of major depressive disorder. The drug is currently in phase II stage of development.

There are approx. 75+ key companies which are developing the therapies for Major Depressive Disorder. The companies which have their Major Depressive Disorder drug candidates in the most advanced stage, i.e. Preregistration include SAGE Therapeutics.
