Russia has carried out about 20 waves of missile and drone strikes on Ukraine since October 10, targeting energy infrastructure and hitting other civilian sites.

The campaign has all but ended, however, without knocking out the Ukrainian grid during the winter. Officials said earlier this month that repairs have been completed in all areas.

Ukrainian officials, foreign intelligence services, and independent analysts all assess that Russiaâ€™s missile stocks have dwindled. There has not been a significant wave since March, with Russia carried out individual, deadly strikes which have destroyed apartment blocks and residential houses.

Last Friday, 15 civilians were slain in Slovyansk in eastern Ukraine when S-300 missiles levelled apartments.
