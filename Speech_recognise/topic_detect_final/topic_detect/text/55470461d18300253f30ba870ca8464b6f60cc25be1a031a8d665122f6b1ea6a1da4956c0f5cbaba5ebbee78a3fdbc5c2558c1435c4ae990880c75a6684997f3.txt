Another fan of Falconâ€™s Fury also posted the return of the iconic thrill ride. Theme Park enthusiast and fabulous YouTuber Theme Park Express (@ThemeParkExpres on Twitter) also posted their excitement about the reopening ride:

Falconâ€™s Fury is a 310-foot drop tower at Busch Gardens Tampa and drops Guests at 60 miles per hour, hitting you with 3.5 G-force as you fall to the ground from a high altitude.

Fans have been waiting for this iconic ride to reopen, and the time has finally come! Until Buschc Gardens Tampa closes today, fans can enjoy the thrill ride again and again!

Busch Gardens Tampa temporarily closed Falconâ€™s Fury for inspection following theÂ Orlando FreeFall accident at ICON Park in March last year. The drop tower would reopen later and close for regular maintenance. After a year of closure due to supply chain delays, the Park announced Falconâ€™s Fury would reopen for the Spring 2023 season, which happens today.
