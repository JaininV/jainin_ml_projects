Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:) is said to have notified staff of a new major round of layoffs, with the official announcement due as early as today, April 19th, 2023, Vox reported early Wednesday.

According to people familiar with the matter, the company intends to cut as many as 4,000 positions across a variety of technical teams, including those working on Facebook, Instagram, Reality Labs, and WhatsApp.

Per the internal memo seen by Vox, North American Meta employees will be informed by email on Wednesday between 04:00 and 05:00 a.m. PT. The company is also reportedly asking workers who can work from home to do so, to give those affected "space to process the news."

The move appears to follow the announcement by Meta's CEO Mark Zuckerberg back in March when he disclosed the company intends to eliminate 10,000 more positions over the coming months.

At the time, Zuckerberg said tech departments will be impacted in April, while the business side's cuts will take effect in May, meaning the company may announce yet another round of cuts as soon as next month.

The parent of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp is just one of many major IT firms making repeated staff reductions - just a few weeks prior Amazon (NASDAQ:) announced its latest wave of layoffs, affecting 9,000 employees.

Shares of META are trading 0.80% lower in pre-market on Wednesday.
