The famous media personality, Toke Makinwa causes a stir after flaunting her figure 8 shape at a friend’s recent event.

Toke who is currently outside the country for her friend’s 40th birthday shared pieces of her fun time at the event with her fans.

In a video via the OAP’s Snapchat, she stirred mixed reactions after flaunting her surgery-enhanced shape. She could be seen approaching her friends with noticeable stepping and concluded it by showing off her behind.

The Brazilian Butt Lift (BBL) of Toke Makinwa is once again tabled for discussion following the video.

Phrankleen wrote: “The ones I feel sorry for are the young ones with impressionable minds 🤦🏽‍♂️. They sell this falsehood as being normal which in turn destroys the minds of the black society.

The idea of being natural, zero bleaching, embracing your default natural look is constantly being demonised on purpose by handpicked gatekeepers who help drive the evil agenda. The winners are the pharmaceutical companies, Bleaching Cream companies all controlled by the Global Organised Criminal Network.

The gatekeepers get their rewards in career and social climb, financial and material rewards and being inevitably sworn to defending global white supremacy.”

Abiola_bolanle01 noted: “Them never start to dey do better yansh the time she did her own cos what In the spongebob square pants is this.”

Kv_by_kelvin_ added: “It might not be perfect but her butt isn’t bad. You can tell it feels slightly off from her body type but still not a badly done butt.”
