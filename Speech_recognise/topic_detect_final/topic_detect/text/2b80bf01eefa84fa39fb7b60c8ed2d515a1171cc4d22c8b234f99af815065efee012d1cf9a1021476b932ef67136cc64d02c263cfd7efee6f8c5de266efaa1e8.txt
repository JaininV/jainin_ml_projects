Founding members Billy Gibbons and Frank Beard (ironically the only one without facial hair) were joined by Elwood Francis on bass, the band’s longtime guitar tech. Hill, as his health declined, had given his heartfelt approval to Francis who knew the discography cold after some twenty years at his side.

The set list hit the band’s highest notes, one after another showcasing their incredible history and ability to hold on to an audience. “Under Pressure” kicked things off, setting the tone for the night with its driving rhythm and hefty scaling bass.

“Gimme All Your Lovin’,” “I’m Bad, I’m Nationwide,” and “Legs,” all had the crowd singing and dancing along. The band paid tribute to American tradition with their rendition of Merle Travis’ “Sixteen Tons.” They delivered an unusual treat in their first encore with “Brown Sugar,” from their first album. The evening ended on its highest possible note with, “La Grange,” the song that first drew world-wide acclaim to the band.

Most of the audience recognized the poignant moment when the band played “Just Got Paid,” one of Hill’s earliest signature songs. The nod to history drew cheers and applause, honoring Hill’s memory and the band’s enduring legacy.
