(AFRICAN EXAMINER) – Nigeria will find out their 2023 FIFA U-20 World Cup opponents on Friday, April 21 when the draw will be made at the Home of FIFA in Zurich.

The Flying Eagles qualified for the World Cup after finishing in third place at the 2023 Africa U-20 Cup of Nations in Egypt last month.

The Flying Eagles are in Pot 3 alongside Uzbekistan, Japan, Iraq, Honduras and Fiji.

Flying Eagles coach, Ladan Bosso, has invited39 players to a training camp to begin their final preparations for the tournament in Argentina, with 2023 Super Eagles invitees Chijioke Aniagboso and Daniel Bameyi part of the group.

Following their below par performance at the U-20 AFCON, the Nigeria Football Federation has charged Bosso’s team to win the tournament.

Meanwhile, Argentina will host this year’s edition from May 20 to June 11, after FIFA stripped Indonesia of the hosting rights just weeks before kick-off.

Having been awarded hosting rights, Argentina will participate in Indonesia’s place, having failed to qualify for the tournament initially.

“FIFA is delighted to announce that this year’s edition of the FIFA U-20 World Cup will take place in Argentina, as the home of the world champions opens its doors to tomorrow’s superstars of world football,” FIFA president Gianni Infantino said in a statement.

A total of twenty-four countries will be drawn into six groups of four with matches taking place in yet-to-be-confirmed venues.

The 2023 FIFA U-20 World Cup kicks off May 20 with the final taking place June 11.
