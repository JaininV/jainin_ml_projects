In June and September, Metapaper organizes Local Print Studio with more than 40 partners from print and design, an afternoon of full paper, and print fun.

For the Local Print Studios, Metapaper has teamed up with exciting local printers in each region to inform you about all kinds of printing techniques, finishing, bindings, as well as future trends in paper and printing. Best of all, it will all take place in one afternoon in a relaxed atmosphere with snacks and drinks.

Topics that you can look forward to

* How and where can I have my small print runs printed? And where is the right place for bigger print runs?

* What printing techniques are there and what are they suitable for? What is behind Riso, letterpress or indigo digital printing, for instance?

* What types of finishing and bindings are available in my region?

* And of course there are lots of creative print examples of every type and great giveaways.

Olaf Stein, Creative Director of Metapaper: “With the Local Print Studios, we want to offer agencies, designers, students and companies the opportunity to get as much inspiration as possible about paper and print from their own region in a relaxed atmosphere in one afternoon. From print run one to infinity, in every conceivable printing technology and with just about every finishing and binding.”
