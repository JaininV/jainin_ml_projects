The likely morning line favorite for the Kentucky Derby is now in Louisville.

Forte arrived at his barn on the back side of Churchill Downs Monday morning after a 14-hour van ride from Florida.

The 3-year-old won last year’s Breeder’s Cup Juvenile and the Florida Derby.

Forte’s owners will find out what spot he is racing out of as the field for the 149th Run for the Rose will be drawn on May 1.
