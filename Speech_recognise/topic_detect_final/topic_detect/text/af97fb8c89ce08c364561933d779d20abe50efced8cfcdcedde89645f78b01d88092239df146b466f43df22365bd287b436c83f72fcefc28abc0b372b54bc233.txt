Scott Morrison was the beneficiary of 12 free tickets in a corporate box for an NRL match last month, according to reports.

The former Prime Minister is a Sharks tragic and snagged the tickets for Cronulla's clash with Parramatta Eels in March, News Corp reports.

On the night, the NRL was not using its corporate hospitality boxes, so offered it to Morrison. It was not staffed or catered.

Morrison is understood to have taken family and friends, including friends from the Horsley Park Rural Fire Service, having kept contact since the Black Summer bushfires.

Darren Notion, Horlsey Park RFS' captain, is a die-hard Eels fan and has attended Sharks v Parramatta matches with Morrison in the past.

The freebie is available to see on Morrison's parliamentary declaration of interests, and it turned out to be a happy evening for the former Prime Minister as his Sharks defeated the Eels by four points.

Last year, Morrison posted a message to former Sharks hero Chad Townsend after the Cowboys star helped defeat his old side in the qualifying final with a superb performance in their 32-30 victory.

'Chad Townsend you made an extraordinary contribution to our club. Sadly you made a really strong one to your new club last night,' he posted on Facebook.

The Cowboys star was quick to reply: 'Scott Morrison [ScoMo] Appreciate the kind words ScoMo! Hope you and the family are keeping well!'

'Chad Townsend great days! Glad to see you and family doing well up in Townsville,' Morrison replied.
