NEW YORK – There’s been so much hype around artificial intelligence lately, especially with the release of AI tools like ChatGPT, MidJourney, Chatsonic, and Google Bard, among many others.

We’ve witnessed AI’s intuitive ability to learn and self-improve—all for our productivity. People’s reservations and fear of its potential negative impact keep growing as it evolves, leading to misconceptions that need to be set right.

Artificial intelligence (AI) simply imitates human intelligence in machines. One of its goals is to raise cognitive reasoning in computers—with more accuracy and lesser bias.

AI has been influencing our daily lives for a long time. For example, it played a significant role in Google/NASA’s discovery of a Kepler-90i planet in 2017, as released on NASA’s website. This was the debut role of AI in astronomy that brought its great potential in space into more limelight.

Artificial intelligence products are evident in smartphones, computers, and IoT devices. You’ve probably witnessed its modern use cases in deep fake videos, image generation, and intuitive AI chatbots.

In addition to its influence on businesses and human tasks, AI cuts across medicine, astronomy, agriculture, and the software industry.

However, misconceptions about AI have raised concerns over time. Futurists and technologists strongly believe that the influence of artificial intelligence is limitless.

Let’s take a critical look at some of these myths and dig up their truths and lies.
