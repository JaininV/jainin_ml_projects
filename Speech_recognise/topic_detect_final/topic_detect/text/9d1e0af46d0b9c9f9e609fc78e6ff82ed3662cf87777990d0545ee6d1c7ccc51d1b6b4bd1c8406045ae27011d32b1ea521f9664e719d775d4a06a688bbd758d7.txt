Aston Villa defender Tyrone Mings has made it into Alan Shearer’s latest Premier League Team of the Week.

The centre-back is one of three Villans players to make the cut in the England legend’s XI for matchweek 31.

Villa boss Unai Emery also made it into Shearer’s selection as his manager of the week.

The Villans delivered an outstanding display to run out 3-0 winners over Newcastle United on Saturday.

Ollie Watkins registered a brace and an assist to take his league tally this season to 14 goals and six assists.

Meanwhile, Jacob Ramsey scored his fourth Premier League goal of the campaign and also grabbed an assist.

Villa’s back line was also in great form, shutting out a dangerous Magpies side and picking up a clean sheet.

Mings weighed in with an impressive six clearances and three blocks as well as two tackles, as per Whoscored.

Shearer loved what he saw from the Villans ace and named him in his back three.

Mings was named in the defence alongside Trent Alexander-Arnold and Lewis Dunk.

“He kept Alexander Isak and Callum Wilson very quiet.”

Mings is enjoying a superb season, his efforts helping Villa mount a late push for Europe.

The Birmingham Mail gave the 30-year-old an 8 out of 10 rating for his heroics against Newcastle.

“Picked up some great positions in the 18-yard box to clear away danger,” they wrote. “Blocked efforts for fun.

“Really good with Southgate in the stands here at Villa Park again. What a season Mings is having.”

Villa are now just six points off the Champions League places with seven games remaining.

Up next for Emery’s charges is the Premier League trip to Brentford on Saturday afternoon.
