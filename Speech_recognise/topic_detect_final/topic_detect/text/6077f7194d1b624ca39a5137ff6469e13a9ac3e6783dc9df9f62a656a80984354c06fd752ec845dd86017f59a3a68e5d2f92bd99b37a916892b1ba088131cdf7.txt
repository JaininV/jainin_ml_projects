April 13, 2023 — OpenSponsorship, the world’s largest sponsorship dealmaking platform, has announced the appointment of Karthik Sridharan to its board.

Sridharan, who founded Kinnek, the New York-based marketplace for SMEs to find suppliers and manage purchasing in 2012, exited the business successfully last year having raised several funding rounds and achieving exponential growth year-on-year.

Sridharan joins other board members including Sean Hanarahan, SVP at Disney and Alexandra Jung, co-founder of Amateras Capital, and will bring real experience and guidance as to how to drive growth for small businesses in the US.

Ishveen Jolly, founder and CEO of OpenSponsorship, said: “I’m so excited for Karthik to join our board. He has been a long-term contact of mine unofficially guiding and supporting me as I grow the business and learn what it takes to be the best CEO I can be. Formalizing this and welcoming him officially is a great moment for the business as we continue to develop the platform, reach new brands, and support more athletes and musicians.”

Karthik Sridharan, board member, OpenSponsorship, said: “OpenSponsorship is, without question, a business going from strength-to-strength. Consistently innovating to create solutions for brands as well as franchises, athletes, leagues, musicians, bands, producers – in fact all its stakeholders! - it is fast, fun and on-track for a bright future. I’m delighted to be joining the board and hopefully able to add some real value.”
