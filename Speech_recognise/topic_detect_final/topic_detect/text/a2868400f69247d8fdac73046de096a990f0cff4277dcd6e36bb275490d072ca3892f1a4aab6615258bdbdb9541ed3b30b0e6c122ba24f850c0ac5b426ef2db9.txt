Hydro vacuum (hydrovac) excavation uses special technology to provide a safer, more effective way of excavating a property than traditional methods like digging. Excavation of a property may be necessary for several situations, such as building a new house with a concrete foundation or repairing or installing a drain. An excavation may also be necessary to expose underground utility lines or other underground items.

If your property needs excavation, Mr. Mike’s Plumbing is one of the few companies in Calgary that offers expert services in hydrovac excavation.

Simply put, the process of excavation involves moving or removing soil. Hydrovac excavation uses highly pressurized water to break up the dirt and rocks underground. The remaining debris and slurry of liquefied soil and water are then removed using an industrial strength vacuum from a special hydro excavation truck into a holding tank, uncovering existing utility lines and pipe systems in the deeper layers of the ground. Hydrovac excavation is much safer than manual digging, keeping the risk of breaks or tears to a minimum. It is also more precise than airvac (a similar process, using air as opposed to water). For this reason, hydrovac excavation is one of the most popular methods of removing and cleaning the ground.

Hydrovac systems are used at a variety of construction sites for repairs and inspections. Some of the specific applications include:

* Daylighting – Daylighting is the process of unearthing any land covered with sand, gravel, concrete, or ice to expose the underlying utilities to the daylight. Hydrovac trucks help to locate the underground utilities by digging trenches into the ground at close proximity to the utilities.

* Installation – Different sized trenches or pits can also be used to install new utilities. Hydrovac trucks help to dig posts, as well as piling holes of different diameters and depths. These holes can then be used to install poles, fences, signs, etc. while also providing the structural foundation to support them. Hydrovacs are ideal for slot trenching, which is the process of digging narrow trenches to install pipelines, cables, posts, etc. Since Hydrovacs are very precise, they are able to dig within narrow dimensions that other methods are not able to achieve.

* Debris Removal and Clean Up – Hydrovac trucks can remove any type of material (wet or dry) such as water, soil, sludge, spills, and other debris. These trucks are useful for cleanup tasks like removing debris from a construction site, cleaning up spills, cleaning hazardous waste, or even cleaning up after natural disasters. The trucks can perform the cleanup tasks from a remote distance, removing traffic from the site.
