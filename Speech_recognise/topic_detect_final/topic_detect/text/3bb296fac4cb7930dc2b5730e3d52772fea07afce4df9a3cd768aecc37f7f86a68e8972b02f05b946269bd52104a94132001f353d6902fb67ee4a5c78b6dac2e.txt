TEHRAN- The spokesman for the Iranian Foreign Ministry has praised the courageous efforts of the Syrian people in protecting their independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity and expressed Tehran’s confidence that Damascus will reclaim its strategic and prominent position in the West Asia region.

In an interview with a reporter from Syria’s official news agency SANA on Monday, Nasser Kanaani noted that “Syria has faced multiple Western conspiracies in recent years” and it has lost a significant number of its citizens who sacrificed their lives in defense of the country’s independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity as well as for the respect and dignity of their country.

The sacrifices made by the Syrian people in battling international terrorism and multinational plots to undermine their nation’s security, stability, and sovereignty are unparalleled and should be memorialized in history, he continued.

Kanaani also said the restoration of diplomatic connections between Damascus and other Arab nations is one of the outcomes of unity between the Syrian leadership and the people.

Arab countries, one by one, are normalizing their ties with Syria.

The Foreign Ministry spokesman also voiced Iran’s optimism and confidence that Syria would be able to rebuild what Takfiri terrorists destroyed and restore its strategic and prominent position in the region because of its skills and political acumen.

Earlier in the day, Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi stated that the global and regional order is turning in favor of free and independent nations as a result of the Islamic Republic’s real collaboration with Syria, as well as the two Muslim governments’ long-standing resistance.

Raisi made the comments in a message of congratulations to his Syrian counterpart Bashar al-Assad on the occasion of Evacuation Day, a national holiday honoring the evacuation of the final French soldier on April 17, 1946, marking the end of the French mandate of Syria after it declared full independence in 1941.

He also expressed hope that the growing cooperation between Tehran and Damascus in a variety of areas will advance their shared objectives and enhance regional peace and stability.
