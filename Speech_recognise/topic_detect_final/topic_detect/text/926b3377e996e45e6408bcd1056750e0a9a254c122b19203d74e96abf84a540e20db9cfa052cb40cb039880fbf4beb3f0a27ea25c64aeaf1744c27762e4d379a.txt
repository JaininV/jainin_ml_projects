We’ve long been fans of M. M.LaFleur’s shoes. I didn’t realize they had a new(ish) slingback until I was doing my research for our roundup of the most comfortable work heels of 2023 a few weeks ago — but I really like them. Slingbacks seem really popular right now, and I like the shape of the vamp.

The brand notes that the heel was designed in response to customer feedback and features a “hand-painted, scratch-resistant 2-inch block heel;” they also note that the heel strap is adjustable.

The heel is $325 full price, including this “rosy taupe” color — suede versions of the shoe are on sale in black, yellow, and light blue.
