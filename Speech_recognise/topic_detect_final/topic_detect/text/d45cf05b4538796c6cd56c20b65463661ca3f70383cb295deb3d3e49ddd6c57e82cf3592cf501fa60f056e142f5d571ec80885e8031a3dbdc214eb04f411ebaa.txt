Scientists have observed that children inherit 25 to 75 new mutations from their parents' DNA, which can be used to classify the type of mutation that occurred based on the ages of the parents. By studying thousands of children, researchers found that the types of mutations passed down from parents to children vary depending on the age of both parents.
