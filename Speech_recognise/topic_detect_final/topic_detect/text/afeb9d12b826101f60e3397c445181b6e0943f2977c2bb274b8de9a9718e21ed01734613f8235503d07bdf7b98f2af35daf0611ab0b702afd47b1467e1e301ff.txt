Today Japanese metal band Babymetal have announced a co-headlining tour with Dethklok. This will be Babymetal‘s  first time back to the US since before the pandemic and the 29 date Babyklok Tour will kick off on  August 30 in Houston before hitting Atlanta, Nashville, Philadelphia, New York, Chicago and  Los Angeles.

Last year Babymetal  was “sealed” from the world after a successful 10-year journey and then in of April of last year, The Other One restoration project began to recover the Babymetal we never knew existed within a virtual world called the Metalverse.

A total of 10 songs were discovered within The Other One  restoration project, with each song representing a unique theme based on 10 separate parallel worlds that the band have discovered

On the heels of the tour announcement comes the news of the long-awaited return of Adult Swim’s favorite heavy metal adventure, “Metalocalypse.” In addition to Dethklok  hitting the road, a full-length original film written and directed by Brendon Small, Metalocalypse: Army of the Doomstar, a companion soundtrack and Dethalbum IV will also be released this year.
