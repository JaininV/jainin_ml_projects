High school players lace-up the skates in memory of Jack Lyons

Chippewa and West Ferris secondary schools, in partnership with the Lyons family, have teamed up to run a friendly co-ed hockey tournament between the North Bay North Stars, Chippewa and West Ferris secondary schools.

Proceeds from the tournament will be donated to the Jack Lyons Autism Summer Camps fund held by One Kids Place.

The North Stars will take on a combined West Ferris and Chippewa co-ed team from 11:40 a.m. to 12:20 p.m.

The second game will be a match-up between West Ferris girls versus Chippewa girls’ hockey teams from 12:25 to 1 p.m. and game three takes place at 1:05 p.m. when the West Ferris boys team play against the Chippewa boys.

Organizers expect Grade 7 and 8 students, about 600, from both high schools will be in attendance.

Secondary students will be able to buy out of class and attend.

Jack Lyons was a Chippewa student who became an integral part of the Chippewa community.

“Jack was an avid hockey supporter and a huge fan of the North Bay Battalion and Powassan Voodoos,” according to a media release.
