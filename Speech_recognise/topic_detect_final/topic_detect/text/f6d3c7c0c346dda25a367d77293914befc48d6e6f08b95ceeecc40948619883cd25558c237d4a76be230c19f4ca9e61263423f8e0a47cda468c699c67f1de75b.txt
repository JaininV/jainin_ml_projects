Following on from my inital post earlier this week, the wonderful s.akira0413 also provides a wonderful feed of JDM Classic scans.

This is just a beauty from August 1986 – those conservative JDM lines make this a thing to lust for – beauty is the eye of the beholder!

I also wonder why this JDM has also not been cast in 1/64 scale – there is a wealth of models to do…….but yet no take up…….and we get more GT-R’s which is now like flogging a dead horse. Food for thought here.
