HONOR Philippines is all set to conquer the country’s elusive smartphone market. The global provider of smart devices recently opened its first-ever experience store—a beginning of a series of experience store openings across the country this year.

The first HONOR Experience Store opened at SM City Fairview (3/F Cyberzone) on April 15, 2023, a payday weekend. To make the event more remarkable, HONOR Philippines also unveiled its limited-edition HONOR X9a 5G Midnight Black, the newest variant of the popular HONOR X9a 5G.

“In just four months this year, HONOR has introduced four new HONOR X series devices that truly uplifted the lifestyle of our consumers,” said HONOR Philippines Vice President Stephen Cheng. “Aside from that, we’ve expanded our brand presence and partnerships with our dealers, establishing more than 500 kiosks across the country.”

HONOR Philippines has officially announced the opening of more experience stores across Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. The brand aims to unveil at least 100 experience stores until yearend.

“We truly felt the support of our HONOR fans, that’s why starting today, April 15, we will commence opening HONOR Experience Stores nationwide to provide the best service to our consumers,” Cheng added.

Here’s the initial schedule of HONOR Experience Store openings in the coming months:
