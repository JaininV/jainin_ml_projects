Kansas has joined a growing number of states which have now passed new laws allowing survivors of child sex abuse additional time to file civil lawsuits against their abusers and the institutions that enabled the conduct, and removed any statute of limitations on criminal prosecution of child sex offenders.

Governor Laura Kelly signed a bill into law on Monday, which allows individuals to file Kansas child sexual abuse lawsuits until they are 31 years old, or three years after a criminal conviction. However, the new law does not go as far as other recent child sex abuse laws enacted in Maryland, New York, New Jersey, California and other states, which have revived previously barred claims for older adults.

The bill, S Sub HB 2127, passed both the Kansas State House and Senate with unanimous bipartisan support. In addition to giving child sex abuse survivors 13 years after their 18th birthday to file a civil lawsuit, the bill also removes the statute of limitations for criminal prosecution of child sex offenders entirely.

Unlike most child sex abuse reform laws passed by other states in recent years, the Kansas legislature did not create a “window” for the filing of lawsuits which have already passed their statute of limitations, meaning there will not be an opportunity for individuals abused decades ago as children to seek justice.

Kansas currently has a statute of repose, which prevents victims of abuse that occurred before 1984 from bringing cases forward. This new law does not change that.
