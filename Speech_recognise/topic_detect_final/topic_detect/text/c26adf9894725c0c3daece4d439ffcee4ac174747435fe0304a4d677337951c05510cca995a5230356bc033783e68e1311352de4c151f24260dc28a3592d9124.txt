Earlier this month, the Samsung Galaxy F54 5G’s support page went live on Samsung India’s website. A recent report claimed that the F54 would be announced by the end of this month in the country. Ahead of the expected launch, the Galaxy F54 has surfaced in the database of the Google Play Console.

The Google Play Console listing for the Galaxy F54 5G has an image of the phone in addition to some of its specifications. As can be seen in the image below, the Galaxy F54 has a waterdrop notch screen on the front and a triple camera unit with LED flash on the back.

The Play Console listing of the Galaxy F54 5G reveals that it is powered by the Samsung s5e8835 chipset, which is nothing but the Exynos 1380 chipset. The SoC is coupled with 8 GB of RAM. The device features a Full HD+ (1080 x 2400 pixels) display and runs on Android 13 OS.

Rumors are rife that the Galaxy F54 5G will be a rebranded version of the Galaxy M54 5G. In India, the F54 is likely to be sold via Flipkart, whereas the M54, which may debut a bit later, could be available through Amazon.

The Galaxy M54, which is already available in some other markets, has a 6.7-inch S-AMOLED FHD+ display with Gorilla Glass 5, a side-facing fingerprint scanner, an Exynos 1380 chipset, 8 GB of RAM, 128 GB / 256 GB of storage, and a 6,000mAh battery with 25W charging. It has a 32-megapixel front camera and a 108-megapixel (main, with OIS) + 8-megapixel + 2-megapixel triple camera unit on the back.
