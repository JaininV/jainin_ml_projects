A MAN has been arrested after three women were allegedly sexually assaulted inside a Victoria's Secret lingerie store.

Cops were called to the shop in The Bullring shopping centre in Birmingham, West Midlands, on March 11 after a woman in her 20s claimed that she had been groped.

Adam Dutton, 34, was arrested in connection with that attack, while detectives believe that two other women were assaulted around the same time.

West Midlands Police confirmed the arrest and urged the other two victims to get in touch.

Dutton has since been released on bail while the investigation continues.

A spokesperson for the force said: "A man has been arrested in connection with a sexual assault inside the Bullring - and we're urging other potential victims to come forward.

"A woman in her 20s was sexually assaulted in Victoria's Secret around 3.30pm on March 11.

"We arrested a 34-year-old man in connection with the incident, he has been released on bail pending further enquiries."

They added: "We believe two other women may also have been sexually assaulted at the same time, but have not yet got in touch with police.

"We know not everyone feels comfortable contacting the police, please remember there are many other organisations you can contact if you don't want to come to us for whatever reason."

If you were assaulted or have any information, you are encouraged to contact the force on 101.
