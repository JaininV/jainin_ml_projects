In a now-viral TikTok video, comedian and TV host Vice Ganda could be seen happily mingling with a large crowd of fans right after her concert in Edmonton, Canada, when suddenly she whirled around and asked: “Who did that!?”

Apparently, a couple of fans had pulled at Vice’s hair, because she then said: “Who did that? That’s very disrespectful! You don’t do that. You have to say sorry to me. Who did that? You don’t do that. That’s very rude. I’m trying to give you a wonderful time, but don’t hurt me, di ba? That’s not right. We have to be friends here. Don’t hurt me.”

When other fans pointed out the couple who were behind the deed, Vice addressed them directly and told them: “This guy is very rude! Both of you are very rude.”

Vice’s concert “VGful Tour” is currently touring Canada and the US.
