An advocacy  campaign by the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry (AAPD) to allow oral  health surgeries to be performed in ambulatory surgical centers (ASCs) has elicited  bipartisan support in the U. S. Congress.

Letters from  the U. S. House of Representatives and U.S. Senate were sent this week to the U.S.  Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services urging that the change be  implemented in the 2024 outpatient prospective outpatient payment system (OPPS)  rule, according to the AAPD. If the new dental surgical code is adopted, it would expand access to oral health  surgeries for children served by the Medicaid program and for people with  disabilities, the academy said.

Reps. Drew  Ferguson (R-GA) and Terrie Sewell (D-AL) and Sens. Ben Cardin (D-MD) and Marsha  Blackburn (R-TN) led the letter-writing effort in Congress. Meanwhile, the  Health Task Force of the Consortium for Constituents with Disabilities has also  submitted a separate letter to request urgent action in support  of the AAPDâ€™s message, the academy said.
