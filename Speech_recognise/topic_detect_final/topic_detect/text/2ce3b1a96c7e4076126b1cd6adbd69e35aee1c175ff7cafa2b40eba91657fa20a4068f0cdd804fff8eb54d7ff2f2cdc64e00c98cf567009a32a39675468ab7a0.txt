A Cumberland County deputy went to serve papers at a residence in the area of Dayton Spur Road when he was attacked by a large dog.

Tuesday morning, a deputy went to the residence when a woman came to the door. She asked the deputy to wait a minute so she could contain her dog in another room. The dog, who was barking and jumping at the door suddenly snuck through and charged at the deputy.

According to the police report, the deputy retreated away from the door as the dog lunged at him. He placed his right arm up to block the advancing dog when the dog bit the deputy on the forearm knocking him off balance. As he was falling, he retrieved his pepper spray to try and spray the dog, however, the dog latched onto his left boot and began to violently shake it.

The woman tackled the dog to restrain it and stop the attack on the deputy. She was able to put the dog inside the house.

EMS helped the deputy clean up his wounds. It wasn’t noted in the police report if the deputy had to have any further medical treatment.

The owners of the dog were asked to quarantine the dog for ten days until Animal Control was able to clear the dog’s records of updated shots.
