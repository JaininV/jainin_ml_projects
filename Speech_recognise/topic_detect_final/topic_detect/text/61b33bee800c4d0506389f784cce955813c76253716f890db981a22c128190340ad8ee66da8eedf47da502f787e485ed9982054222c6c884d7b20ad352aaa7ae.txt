Gail Cronin’s daughter Elizabeth Feore was sitting at home in Atikokan, Ontario reading her copy of The Expositor when her son Masi came in from playing hockey bearing an item that featured a striking coincidence. “She was reading The Manitoulin Expositor and found the story of the ‘Water Walker’ (March 15, Page 1, ‘Autumn Peltier featured on chocolate bar’),” explained her mother, Gail Cronin of Sheguiandah, who contributed this photo. “Her son Masi just got home from hockey and had one of the chocolate bars with Autumn’s picture.” It was a delicious coincidence.
