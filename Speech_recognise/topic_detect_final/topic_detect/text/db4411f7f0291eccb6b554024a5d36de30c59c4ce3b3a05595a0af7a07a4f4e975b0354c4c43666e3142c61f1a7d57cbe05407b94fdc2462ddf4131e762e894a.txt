The AIADMK on April 19 decided to field its nominee in one Assembly constituency—Pulakeshinagar (reserved for Scheduled Castes) of Karnataka, where polling would take place for the Assembly elections on May 10.

A release issued by the party’s general secretary, Edappadi K. Palaniswami, named the Karnataka State unit’s praesidium chairman, D. Anbarasan, as the candidate.
