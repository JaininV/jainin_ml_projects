Mildred Arlene Kisner was born November 13, 1928 in Butler, Missouri to Daniel Adolph “Ottie” and Ida Marie Baker Kauffman.  She was united in marriage to Clyde Eugene Kisner on September 18, 1947.  Together, they raised a family and owned and operated D&D Tire in Butler for many years.  She was a long-time member of Double Branch Christian Church.

Arlene was an avid reader and would often times spend hours enjoying her books.  She was also blessed with a green thumb.  She seemed to have a magical touch that allowed her to grow the most beautiful flowers and nurse back to health almost any plant.  Arlene was especially fond of geraniums.

If Arlene liked you, you knew it, if she didn’t like you, you still knew it.  She was never one to hold back her opinion, but if you were someone who was lucky enough to be loved by her, she would have given you everything she had if you were in need.

Arlene was preceded in death by her parents, sister Dorothy Wheatley, brothers Lloyd and Raymond Kauffman, and son David Kisner.  She is survived by her son Danny and wife Debbie of Butler, son Doug and wife Judy of Butler, grandchildren Daniel Kisner and wife Liz, Dannette Underwood and husband Eric, Dalena Kisner, Dusty Kisner.  She is also survived by great-grandchildren, Riggen, Raeth, Robey, Lena, and Orrion Kisner, and Ty Underwood and Dayten Kisner, Alexis, Levi, Dalila Dotson and Karter Skai Kisner.  Along with great-great-grandchildren Adaline and Everly Underwood.
