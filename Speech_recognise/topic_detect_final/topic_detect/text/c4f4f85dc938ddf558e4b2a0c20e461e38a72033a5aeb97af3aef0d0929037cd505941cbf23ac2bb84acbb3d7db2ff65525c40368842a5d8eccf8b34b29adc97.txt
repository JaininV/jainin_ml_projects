If you didn't dream of one day discovering that you're the heir to the throne of a small European country, were you even born in the 90s? This particular fantasy was largely encouraged by the 2001 Disney film,’ ‘The Princess Diaries’. The romcom saw a baby-faced Anne Hathaway playing Mia Thermopolis, an awkward American teenager who finds out she’s princess to the fictional kingdom of Genovia.

Long story short, she’s introduced to conditioner, learns to curtsy and cut ribbons and almost kills off the queen, aka Julie Andrews, while attempting to drive stick across San Francisco.

Now, 20 years on from Andrews’ iconic one-liner, ‘Goodbye, trolley people’ you can buy the mansion which doubled as Grove High School, if you’ve got $8.9 million to spare, that is.

The chataeu’s grand exterior is visible in several iconic scenes from the movie, including when Mia pulls up to school on her scooter, and later, in her limo. It’s also the backdrop to the satisfying moment when Mia smushes an ice cream cone onto the head of mean girl Lana Thomas ( Mandy Moore.)

First built in 1923 by celebrated architect August Headman, 2601 Lyon street is three-stories tall and spans more than 4,500 square feet, with a distinctive neoclassical Mediterranean design.

In 2009 the palatial property was snapped up by the ex-CEO of Just Desserts -  and dad of the century - Michael Mendes as his seven-year-old daughter was a massive fan of the movie. Since then it has undergone several renovations and now features a lift, rooftop garden and multiple balconies with panoramic views of the city.

If you don’t have the adequate funds to buy the set of your favourite film, fear not, there are other ways to feed your nostalgia. Disney recently revealed that a third ‘Princess Diaries’ movie is in the works.
