Since the demise of the massive Swords venue Jam Park and the Tivoli before it, the electronic promoter collective District 8 have been without a large venue in which to put on more than 500 people in a space, as they have been using Index on Aaran Quay for club nights, rebranded as Here & Now.

It’s a problem replicated in Dublin city generally, with the lack of a space that could cater for 3,000 to 5,000 people or thereabouts.

In February, the Irish Times shared the news that Harry Crosbie was looking to build a 2000-capacity venue in the docklands twice the size of Vicar Street, but if it happens, it’l be a way off yet, and as is customary promoter practice, would likely exclude competitors using it.

While they’ve been biding their time for a venue space big enough, District 8 are seemingly looking outside the city, and are teasing ” a new leafy outpost” which they say are “a stones throw away from Dublin and custom-built for dancers”.

Details dropping very very soon… 💡 pic.twitter.com/tfz76zqe1r— District8 Dublin (@District8Dublin) April 11, 2023

The walled garden aerial shot in the video teaser looks a lot like a space in Kildare about 30 minutes from Dublin, but I won’t say any more than that, so as not to gazzump the official announcement.

Either way, there’s at least one other outdoor electronic day event on the way for Leinster this summer.
