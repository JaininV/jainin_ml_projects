Never again lose your keys, earbuds, wallet, backpack, pet, or even child with a four-pack of Apple AirTags. The tiny tracker, named PCMag Editors' Choice for iOS tracking devices, relies on Bluetooth and Apple's Find My app to locate lost devices. At 1.26 inches in diameter and 0.31 inches thick, its only slightly larger than a quarter, and unnoticeable when dropped into a backpack, coat pocket, or suitcase.

Each comes with a removable cover for easy access to change the pre-installed CR2032 coin cell battery—expected to last about a year.
