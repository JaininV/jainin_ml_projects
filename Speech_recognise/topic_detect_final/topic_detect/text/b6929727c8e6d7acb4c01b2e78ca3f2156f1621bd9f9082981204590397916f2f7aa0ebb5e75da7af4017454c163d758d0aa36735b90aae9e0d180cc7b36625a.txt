A comprehensive 3-0 victory in the first leg at the Etihad a week ago saw Pep Guardiola’s side cement themselves as favourites to go all the way this season and finally secure the one trophy that has continued to elude them.

Barring a complete collapse in Germany, City will soon be turning their focus to the semi-finals, where Real Madrid, who have already knocked out Liverpool and Chelsea this season, are waiting.

Thomas Tuchel will still believe his players can turn this around on home soil, but a weekend draw with Hoffenheim did little to restore the confidence.
