Breckenridge Ski Resort has announced that after Sunday, April 16, the ski resort will shift to its spring operations plan.

Starting on Monday, April 17, Breckenridge will shift its focus to Peaks 6, 7 and 8 for the remainder of the season, which means Peaks 9 and 10 will be closed.

Through April 23, the Colorado SuperChair, Rocky Mountain SuperChair and Rip’s Ride will remain open on Peak 8. Starting on April 24, Breckenridge Ski Resort will begin its late season operations with all terrain being accessed via the Peak 7 base area and the Independence SuperChair.

With the shift to late season operations, Breckenridge Ski Resort will only have intermediate and advanced terrain open and the ski resort will shift its lift hours to 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. for the remainder of the season.

Operation plans are subject to change with Mother Nature having the ultimate say in the resort’s plans. Breckenridge plans to stay open for as long as the snow lasts and hopes to send the season into May.

The list of lifts that will operate for late spring skiing and riding include:

To celebrate the season, Breckenridge Ski Resort will host the annual Splash Into Spring Pond Skim the weekend of April 29. The event will take place on Peak 7 with participants and viewers slipping, sliding and soaking up the sun.

More information on pond skim and events throughout the weekend of April 29 will be announced soon, the resort says.
