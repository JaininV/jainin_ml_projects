“As of April 2021, the Department of Defense has been working on 685 projects which are deeply invested in the development of artificial intelligence. Their budget mainly in the joint AI Center has increased dramatically from 89 million dollars in 2019 to 278 million dollars in 2021.

Clearly the DOD is very much invested into the research and development of AI and using this technology throughout the U. S Armed Forces. But what are their aims? What do they plan on doing with such technology? And what are some of the potential impacts of this?” — Will Griffin
