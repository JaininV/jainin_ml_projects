Colorado State University released its outlook for the 2023 Atlantic hurricane season. Their researchers forecast below normal activity this year.

CSU forecasts 6 of those to become hurricanes, including 2 major hurricanes, which are a Category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.

NOAA will release its 2023 Atlantic hurricane season on May 25.

Accumulated Cyclone Energy, which factors the number of storms and their duration and intensity, is forecast to be 100, compared to an average of 123.

Researchers look at a variety of factors to make their prediction.

El Niño conditions are forecast to return this summer around the peak of hurricane season, which would be the first time since 2018 and 2019. El Niño leads to stronger upper level winds, or wind shear, in the Atlantic, which is less favorable for tropical development.

Remember, predictions of the season’s activity are not predictions of exactly how many storms will make landfall in a particular place. Individual storms make impacts, regardless of how active (or not) a season is. Coastal residents should do what they can to be prepared every year.

The 2023 Atlantic hurricane season will come with some new changes and a new list of names.

This forecast comes after last year's season, which had near-normal activity in terms of named storms and hurricanes, but below-normal ACE.

Of the notable storms, Hurricane Ian and Fiona both got retired after causing significant death and destruction in Central America, the Caribbean, the United States and Canada.
