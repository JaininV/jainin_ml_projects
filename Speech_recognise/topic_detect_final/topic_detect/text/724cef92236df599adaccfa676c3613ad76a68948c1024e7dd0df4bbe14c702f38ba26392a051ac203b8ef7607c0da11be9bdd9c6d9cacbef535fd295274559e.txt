Channel 4 show Naked Education has attracted nearly 1,000 complaints for showing nudity to 14 to 16-year-olds and airing the scenes before the watershed.

The series, hosted by Anna Richardson, is described by the broadcaster as “body-positive” and aims to “normalise all body types, champion people’s differences and break down stereotypes”.

Episodes have tackled issues including body hair, male body image, the effects of ageing and cosmetic surgery. They have also featured participants posing nude in front of a class of young people.

Broadcasting watchdog Ofcom said it had received 930 complaints from viewers relating to an episode that aired on April 4.

It said those complaints related to “nudity before the watershed” and the nudity being “presented to participants in the programme aged 14-16”.

One episode of the show sees the hosts test teenagers’ knowledge of the female anatomy, while another sees them discuss what happens to the body as it ages.

A spokesperson for Ofcom said: “We are assessing the complaints against our broadcasting rules, before deciding whether or not to investigate.”

Naked Education is fronted by television presenter Richardson, best known for presenting Naked Attraction on Channel 4, radio DJ Yinka Bokinni and former Love Island contestant Dr Alex George.

The show features “candid conversations and naked exchanges between people who have undergone similar experiences and body transformations”, the broadcaster said.

Channel 4 has been contacted for comment.
