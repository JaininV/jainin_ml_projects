TEHRAN- In order for peace efforts in Yemen to proceed, the Special Envoy of the United Nations for Yemen, Hans Grundberg, stated on Monday that he is maintaining touch with representatives of Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).

Grundberg was talking to reporters at a virtual briefing on the situation in Yemen, where Ansarullah representatives have been in discussions with Saudi negotiators for the past several days in an effort to put an end to the conflict there that has lasted for eight years.

The UN representative stated that he is in frequent communications with Iranian, Saudi, Emirati, and other authorities regarding the situation in Yemen and expressed hope that the talks will result in progress.

He stated that all parties in Yemenâ€™s war-ravaged country should take advantage of the newly created opportunity to advocate for long-term peace and a political settlement.

In order to reinstate the government of deposed president Abd Rabbuh Mansour Hadi, Saudi Arabia, at the head of a coalition of nations that also included the UAE, launched war on Yemen in March 2015.

Since then, the conflict has resulted in killing of hundreds of thousands of Yemenis both directly and indirectly, according to the UN, which has called Yemen the country experiencing the worst humanitarian catastrophe in the world.

The Ansarullah Movement and Saudi authorities had recently held peace talks in the Yemeni capital Sanaa, which were mediated by Oman.

Ansarullah highlighted progress in the meetings and stated that additional talks are scheduled.
