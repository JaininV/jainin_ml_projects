Nothing gets the blood boiling quite like some duffer on your favourite sporting team botching a simple play only for your team to lose in the dying seconds.

And if that sounds like your sports team of choice AND your propensity to throw things at the TV set in a fit of rage then you’ll empathise with a new spot from US cable sports site, Bally Sports.

In the comical spot, Bally says it’s developed an inflatable device (that it admits looks remarkably like a kids’ floatie device) to protect the TV screen from angry fans chucking the remote.

The spot’s fronted by musician and actor Jeff Harms and is the work of Las Vegas-based creative agency R&R Team.

Sadly, Bally aren’t giving away the inflatable safety devices, saying, “Our cautious lawyers are too cautious to let us give these away.”
