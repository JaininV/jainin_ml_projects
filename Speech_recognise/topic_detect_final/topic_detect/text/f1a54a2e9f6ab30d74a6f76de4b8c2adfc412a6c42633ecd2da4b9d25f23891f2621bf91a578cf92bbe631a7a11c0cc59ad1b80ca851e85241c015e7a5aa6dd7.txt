New Delhi: Mumbai Indians beat Sunrisers Hyderabad by 14 runs, courtesy of Cameron Green scoring 64* off 40 and picking up a wicket. Meanwhile, another hero of the game was youngster Arjun Tendulkar who picked his maiden IPL wicket and also defended 20 runs in the last over. As he dismissed Bhuvneshwar Kumar in the 20th over, netizens came up with an interesting trivia involving Arjun’s father, Sachin Tendulkar.

In 2009, Bhuvneshwar Kumar became the first and the only bowler to dismiss Sachin Tendulkar for a duck in Ranji Trophy. 14 years later, his son Arjun Tendulkar picked Bhuvneshwar Kumar as his first IPL wicket. Coincidently, both incidents occurred in Hyderabad.
