According to sources within the company, Meta (formerly Facebook) is planning another round of layoffs this week, as per a report by Vox. The restructuring is part of CEO Mark Zuckerberg's "Year of efficiency" plan, which was announced in March and will see the cutting of 10,000 jobs related to low-priority projects. These layoffs come on top of the 11,000 jobs that were cut last November.

There could be as many as 4,000 layoffs this week, but this has not been confirmed. Zuckerberg had previously stated that April would see layoffs in the tech divisions, followed by another round in May affecting the company's business side.

Speculation is rife that the layoffs will target projects and teams within the Facebook app and Reality Labs, which focuses on augmented and virtual reality experiences. However, the game development teams may be safe for now, as Meta looks to market its metaverse concept to traditional gamers.

This may be a strategic move on the part of Meta and Zuckerberg, who has been promoting the metaverse as a place for social interactions, employment, and e-commerce. Horizon Worlds, the social VR platform that Meta has invested significantly in, has not yet taken off, with only 200,000 monthly active users as of the end of last year.
