Ultimate Fighting Championship President Dana White proudly told Fox News Channel host Dan Bongino that his multibillion-dollar business doesn't "do anything woke" at all.

"I think obviously the fact that we figured out how to go through COVID. We were first to fill stadiums when all the COVID bans were being lifted," he said Saturday on Unfiltered.

He added, "It grew our business like 70% or something like that because we were the only thing to watch. And we don’t do anything woke over here at all."

Last weekend, former President Donald Trump made an appearance at UFC 287 in Miami, where he sat in the front row with Kid Rock, Mike Tyson, and Dana White.

The crowd went wild for the former president when he stood to wave. They enthusiastically cheered, "USA!"

From inside the ring, Jorge Masvidal, one of the UFC's top stars, pointed at Trump and gushed, "Greatest president in the history of the world, I love that guy."

He also praised Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) and started a chant with the crowd of “Let’s go, Brandon,” slamming current President Joe Biden.
