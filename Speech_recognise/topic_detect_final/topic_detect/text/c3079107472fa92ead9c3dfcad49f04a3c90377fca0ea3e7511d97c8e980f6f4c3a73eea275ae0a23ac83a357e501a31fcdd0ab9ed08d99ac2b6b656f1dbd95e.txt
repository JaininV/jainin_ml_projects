A LOTTERY winner who came into millions of dollars lost the total sum in just four years, calling the experience very depressing.

Within days, her purchase had paid off; she had won $1 million dollars.

Excited by her luck, Arcand reportedly began to splurge her cash.

She quickly hosted a party for friends and family, who ordered several bottles of $200 wine at the event, according to the Eagle Tribune.

Arcand's son was then said to have been enrolled in a private school with a $10,000 annual tuition.

She went on a few vacations and bought a brand-new furnished house.

Arcand then embarked upon her 'dream' of buying and operating a restaurant in her hometown.

However, due to financial difficulties, she was 'forced' to shut her business.

At that time, the lottery mandated annual payments of $35,000, rather than a lump sum.

However, Arcand partnered with a financial services company that gave her an upfront payment of $200,00 in exchange for $15,000 of her winnings per year.

This put her into a higher tax bracket, meaning that she lost more money than she would have otherwise.

In 2007, Arcand said that the experience had been 'very depressing' overall.

This fate has plagued many lottery winners.

One man who won the Powerball lottery in the early 2000s spent all of his winnings and lived in a storage shed before his death.

David Lee Edwards, a convicted felon from Ashland, Kentucky, won a one-quarter share, about $27 million after taxes, from the Powerball jackpot of $280 million during August 2001.

Edwards quickly married Shawna Maddux in Malibu, California, and went to work spending his newfound fortune.

The massive purchases included a mansion within a gated community in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, along with over a dozen expensive cars, and even a private LearJet, per the Courier-Journal.

Just five years later, he had allegedly succumbed to drug addiction and was living in a storage shed covered in human feces.
