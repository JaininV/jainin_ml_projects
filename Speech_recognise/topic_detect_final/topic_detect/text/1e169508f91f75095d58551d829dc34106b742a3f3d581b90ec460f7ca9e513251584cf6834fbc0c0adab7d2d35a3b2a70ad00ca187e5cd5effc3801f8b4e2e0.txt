If you remember, DNA tests were all the hype at one point. People were getting tested to know their bloodline and how far it went. For many of us, it was merely anything serious, just a fun test. But for Molly Sinert and Emily Bushnell, the results came with shocking findings.

At a young age, Molly was adopted into a loving family in Florida. Molly found a new home with her foster parents. The Jewish family welcomed her wholeheartedly. Content with her family, she never searched for her biological parents or any other members.

Emily was also adopted by a Jewish family and grew up not knowing she had a sister. One day her daughter, Isabel, asked if Emily would take a DNA test because she knew Emily was adopted. The little girl wanted to connect to the other side of the family if one existed. But Emily refused, so Isabel took the test herself.

On the other side of the country, Molly took a DNA test around the same time because of some health issues. When the results came back, she was shocked: it said there was a person whose DNA matched 49.96% to Molly’s and that person was most likely her daughter.

Molly knew that she had never been pregnant, let alone given birth to a baby. What followed was an amazing connection and reunion. To know the whole story, watch the full video below and please leave us a Facebook comment to let us know what you thought!
