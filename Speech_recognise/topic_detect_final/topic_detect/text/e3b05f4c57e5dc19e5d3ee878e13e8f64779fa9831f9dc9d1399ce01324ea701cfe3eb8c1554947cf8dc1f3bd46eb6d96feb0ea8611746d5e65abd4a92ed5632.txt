Former Ukrainian deputy prime minister Oleh Rybachuk reacted to Viktor Orbán’s radio interview during which the Hungarian PM said Ukraine was a non-existent country financially. The former country leader said Hungarians would be ashamed when the war ends.

Orbán’s radio interview provoked a harsh reaction from the Russian and Ukrainian sides. Former Russian President Medvedev praised the Hungarian prime minister, while Kyiv condemned Orbán’s thoughts. Orbán said it was a question of whether “we” (i.e. the European taxpayers) sustain Ukraine because without Western help, the country would have already collapsed. “We subsidize the Ukrainian pensions and salaries. Meanwhile, they slam the Hungarian community in Transcarpathia”.

Mr Rybachuk said Ukraine’s EU and NATO membership is getting closer, and because of that Orbán’s rhetoric will soon change. It is imaginable that Orbán will visit Ukraine if Washington’s and Brussels’ pressure is successful, he added. The Ukrainian politician highlighted that Hungary would never be a trustworthy ally, so Ukraine should search for true friends.

He said that the moment the war ends, Hungarians will feel ashamed because no one can explain the country’s shameful policies. “Hungary is the perfect example of what other EU member states should never become”, Rybachuk concluded.

Grain transports from Ukraine are being checked and sealed at the border, and only those in transit to other countries are allowed to enter Hungary, a state secretary of the agriculture ministry said at the border crossing at Záhony, in northeast Hungary, on Tuesday. After reviewing the implementation of the ban on Ukrainian grain imports, which the government announced on Saturday, Márton Nobilis said the transports were monitored throughout their journey across Hungary.

“Our aim is to protect Hungarian farmers from Ukrainian grain flooding the country,” he said, adding that the ministry was mulling an extension of the ban to other food products.
