RwandAir has announced plans to launch nonstop flights to Paris for the first time.

The thrice weekly service between Kigali and Paris CDG will launch on June 27, departing the Rwandan capital at 0030 on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday, arriving into Paris at 0930.

The return leg will leave the French capital at 2130 on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday, arriving into Kigali at 0600 the following day.

The new route represents the only direct service between Rwanda and France, and adds to the carrier’s existing flights to London Heathrow, which have operated nonstop since November last year (having previously routed via Brussels).

RwandaAir recently took delivery of its third A330 aircraft, as part of the airline’s “ambitious growth strategy”.

The carrier wants to double its fleet over the next five years, alongside moving into its new home at Bugesera International airport.

The facility is under construction 25 miles south of Kigali International airport, with phase 1 of the project currently scheduled to open in 2026.

Last September RwandAir also confirmed that it was exploring the possibility of joining the Oneworld alliance.

Commenting on the news Yvonne Makolo, RwandAir CEO, said:

“The launch of our first-ever flights to Paris is an exciting development in RwandAir’s continuing expansion and a testament to the importance of French-Rwandan relations.

“France is a major market for RwandAir as we connect the continents of Africa and Europe through our home hub in Kigali with this new direct service to Paris, one of the world’s top tourism destinations.

“French travellers can look forward to a warm welcome onboard on our inaugural flight today and for many more years to come as we deepen the ties of friendship and fraternity between France and Rwanda.”
