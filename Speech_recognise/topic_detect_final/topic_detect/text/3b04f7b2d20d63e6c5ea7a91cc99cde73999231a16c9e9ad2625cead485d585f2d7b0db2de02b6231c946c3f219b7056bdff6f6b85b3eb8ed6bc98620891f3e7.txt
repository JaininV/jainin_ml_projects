Funeral for 64-year-old husband, father of 4, killed in mass shooting held Sunday evening

FRANKLIN COUNTY FLIER. LOOKING THROUGH JIM TODD SENIOR YEARBOOK. HIS FORMER FRENCH TEACHER REMEMBERS WHEN HE WALKED THE HALLS OF FRANKLIN COUNTY HIGH SCHOOL AS HERE’S HIS SENIOR PICTURE. JAMES 831 BY JIMMY. IT WAS 1977 IN FRANKFORT WHEN TODD LEFT HIS MARK ON FRANKLIN COUNTY. BUT TERRY JOHNSON NEVER IMAGINED ONE OF HIS STUDENTS WOULD. ONE DAY BECOME A VICTIM OF A MASS SHOOTING. IT’S A TRAUMATIC AND TRAGIC EVENT, BUT WHEN YOU KNOW SOMEONE PERSONALLY THAT’S INVOLVED IN THAT, IT MAKES IT EVEN WORSE. JIM TODD WAS ONE OF FIVE PEOPLE TRAGICALLY SHOT AND KILLED ON MONDAY AT OLD NATIONAL BANK DOWNTOWN. HE LIVED AND WORKED IN LOUISVILLE, BUT GROWING UP, FRANKFORT IS WHERE THE 64 YEAR OLD MARKET EXECUTIVE CALLED HOME. JOHNSON HAS TAUGHT AT FRANKLIN COUNTY HIGH SCHOOL FOR MORE THAN 50 YEARS AND SAYS HE KNEW BOTH TODD AND HIS FATHER. HE REMEMBERS TODD AS A RESPECTFUL AND KIND STUDENT BACK IN THE SEVENTIES. WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT PHOTO, HOW TERRIBLE IT IS AS SOMETHING WHAT HAPPENED TO A PERSON WITH SUCH A GOOD YOUNG MAN OR SCHOOL? YOU KNOW, PART OF OUR SCHOOL AND AND OBVIOUSLY WE DON’T DO GREAT THINGS WITH HIS LIFE, BOTH IN HIS PUBLIC AND PRIVATE LIFE. IT JUST MAKES IT EVEN MORE OF A TRAGEDY. TUTT WAS ACTIVE IN THE COMMUNITY, SERVING ON THE BOARD OF THE OLDHAM LA GRANGE DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY. HE LEAVES BEHIND HIS WIFE, KAREN, THEIR CHILDREN AND THEIR GRANDCHILDREN. WHILE THE MASS SHOOTING HAPPENED IN LOUISVILLE, FRANKFORT CITY COMMISSIONER PATRICIA WOOLDRIDGE SAYS TUT’S HOMETOWN IS HURTING. AND TO SEE THAT SOMEONE IS ACTUALLY FROM FRANKFORT AND YOU GO TO HIS FACEBOOK PAGE AND HE IS VERY PROUD OF IT. HE’S A NATIVE OF FRANKFORT AND A GRADUATE OF FRANKLIN COUNTY HIGH. THAT REALLY HITS HOME IN FRANKFORT, WHERE YOU WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL MATTERS. IT’S A CLOSE KNIT COMMUNITY AND THE ENTIRE CITY IS MOURNING THE LOSS OF A FORMER FLIER. JOHNSON SAYS HE WANTS TUT’S FAMILY TO KNOW FRANKFORT CARES, AND HE’LL ALWAYS BE REMEMBERED BY HIS FLIER FAMILY. AS WE SAY HERE AT FRANKLIN COUNTY, ONCE A FLOWE
