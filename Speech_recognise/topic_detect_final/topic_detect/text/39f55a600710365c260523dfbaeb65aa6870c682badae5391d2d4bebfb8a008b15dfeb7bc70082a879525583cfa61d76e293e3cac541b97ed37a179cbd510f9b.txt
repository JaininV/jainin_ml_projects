The Kenya National Highway Authority (KeNHA) announced on Thursday, April 19, that it was collaborating with the police to unveil a new technology aimed at reducing traffic violations on Kenyan highways.

KeNHA Senior Compliance Officer Engineer Kennedy Ndugire oversaw the launch of the high-speed weighing motion technology at the Mariakani Weigh Bridge.

Ndugire explained that the technology will compute vehicle weight at high speeds.

The information will then be relayed to a platform, which will determine whether or not the vehicles exceeded their maximum load capacity.

“The machine can detect the weight of vehicles moving at speeds between 40 kilometres and 140 kilometres per hour.

“The system will filter out the vehicles by displaying a red or green light to denote which vehicles can proceed and those that need to go through the station,” he remarked.

Ndugire explained that the technology will reduce traffic on highways caused by transit vehicles queuing to pass through weight inspection centres.

Highway Commandant John Gichohi confirmed that the police will collaborate with the KeNHA.

“The East African Vehicles Road Control Act decriminalises overloading. All vehicles nabbed with gross or axle overload will not be taken to court but will be fined instantly,” he stated.

However, he warned that vehicles that intentionally bypass one weighbridge will be charged.

Furthermore, drivers of transit vehicles transporting goods that are out of gauge or exceed the required dimensions must present special permits.

Weighbridges have been the leading cause of highway traffic jams, forcing motorists and passengers to spend the night on the road.
