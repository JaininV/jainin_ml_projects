You don’t have to be an auto racing fan to don a TAG Heuer Carrera, and you can even venture out into non-traditional colors on the dials of the new Carrera Date 36mm Collection. The smaller diameter is also more accommodating for those who don’t have wrists like John Cena. Four colors including sunray finished dials in signature blue, pastel green, and warm silver, along with a bright pink snailed dial to come shortly after the first three. Each gets a stainless steel case with a matching H-shaped bracelet, gold or rhodium-plated applied indices, and gold or rhodium-plated faceted hour and minute hands with white Super-LumiNova lume. Punctuation is in the form of a date window at the 6 o’clock position. Timekeeping duties come by way of a Swiss Calibre 7 automatic movement with 56 hours of power reserve. It’s available for purchase directly from TAG Heuer now.
