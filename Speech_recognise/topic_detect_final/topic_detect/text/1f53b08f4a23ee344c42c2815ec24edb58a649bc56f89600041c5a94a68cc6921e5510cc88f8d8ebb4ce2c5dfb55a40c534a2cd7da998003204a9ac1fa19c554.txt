Apart from having conversations, players also have to brew various drinks and serve them to customers of the café. Each drink is made up of three ingredients like green tea, milk, honey, and cinnamon, to name only a few. Sometimes, customers will tell players exactly what they want in their drink either by listing ingredients or giving them a name that the player can look up in the recipe app on their in-game cell phone. Other times, customers will instead give players the sort of drink they are interested in and leave the specifics up to the player to figure out. While serving drinks isn't particularly challenging or impactful during the course of the game, it does provide a fun change of pace to keep players engaged and offering a break from reading paragraphs of text.

The mechanic helps ground the player in the world while also revealing interesting aspects of characters through what they like to drink and how they order it. It is an elegant dimension of "Coffee Talk's" story-telling that helps highlight just how special and unique of a series it is. It is the perfect cozy game to curl up under a blanket with on a rainy night and just quietly enjoy with plenty of characters to grow attached to, conversations to think about, and moments to remember.
