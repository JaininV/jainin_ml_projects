What is the difference? And how can you make money as one?

Do you want to become a content creator or an influencer?

Many people have these terms confused, so I felt like it was a must to dive deep into all the specifics of each occupation.

In short, UGC creator is like any other creative profession that offers a recurring income. A photographer, a designer, etc. It provides more stability in your finances, but it is really hard to scale.

Influencers, on the contrary, have less predictable income month-to-month, but their pricing and offers are quite scalable; therefore, there are more perks in becoming an influencer in the long run.

Even though at my agency, we don‚Äôt focus on working with UGC creators and influencers as heavily as agencies whose primary service proposition is creator management and influencer outreach, I‚Äôm heavily invested in all the creator economy news AND ways to earn as a creator/influencer!

Cause that passive income never hurtsüòè
