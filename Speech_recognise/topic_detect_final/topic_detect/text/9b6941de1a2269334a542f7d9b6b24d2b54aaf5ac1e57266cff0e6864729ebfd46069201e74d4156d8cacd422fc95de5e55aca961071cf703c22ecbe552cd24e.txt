Did you know the name ‘Emma’ means whole/complete?  I love that.  If I gave birth to a daughter, it would be high on my list of names (my favourite Blue Heelers character has a mischievous daughter Emma, which is probably why I looked it up).  ‘Perfect’ can mean the same thing.  I guess in Hebrew, they would say shalom.  It’s more than peace; I would call it a wellness of mind and body.

There’s a sense in which we’re perfected when we get to heaven, but Jesus also tells us to be perfect as our heavenly Father is perfect, which leads me to think this wholeness is attainable here on earth as well.  We pray:  “Your kingdom come … on earth as it is in heaven”, so it must be possible.  That’s why I’m always willing to receive prayer for healing (even if medically, nothing can be done).  It doesn’t always happen for everyone this side of heaven, which is one of the big mysteries of the Christian faith.  Even the prayerful and charismatic Paul said in one of his letters:  “I left Trophimus sick”, but that doesn’t mean we should stop asking.

Matthew 5:48:  “Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect”.
