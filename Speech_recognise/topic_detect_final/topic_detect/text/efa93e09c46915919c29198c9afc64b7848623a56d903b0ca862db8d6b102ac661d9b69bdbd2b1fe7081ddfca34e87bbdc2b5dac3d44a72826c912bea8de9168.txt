Romania, EC seeking mechanisms to reduce effects of cereal export from Ukraine

The Government has come up with concrete measures for farmers and food industry producers and aims, together with European Commission representatives, to identify mechanisms to reduce the effects that the transit and export of grain from Ukraine have on farmers in Ukraine's border countries.

The head of the Executive was asked, in a press conference at the end of the National Liberal Party (PNL) National Standing Bureau (BPN) meeting, if Agriculture Minister Petre Daea would be kept in office until the government rotation, even if he did not obtain the necessary European funds for Romanian agriculture, starting from the fact that the Polish Minister of Agriculture resigned after the allocations for farmers received from the European Commission.

"This Government has come up with concrete, real measures for farmers and for those who work in the food industry. We have understood and we understand very well the consequences of grain transit from Ukraine to other destinations. That is why I am asking the farmers and as we have discussed so far and as they have shown understanding so far, I am convinced that there will continue to be this collaboration and this line of identifying solutions to ensure that these consequences have a minimum impact on Romanian farmers," said Nicolae Ciuca.

The Prime Minister mentioned that during the discussions held with farmers from several areas of the country, he gave assurances that the measures supported by the Executive, together with the representatives of the European Commission, aim at identifying those mechanisms to reduce the effects that the transit and export of cereals from Ukraine produce on farmers in the border countries of Ukraine.
