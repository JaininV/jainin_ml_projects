SAUDI Arabia’s top diplomat is due to arrive in Damascus today on the first visit by a Saudi official since the start of Syria’s civil war, Syria’s information ministry said.

Recent months have seen increasing Arab engagement with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who has been politically isolated in the region since the war broke out.
