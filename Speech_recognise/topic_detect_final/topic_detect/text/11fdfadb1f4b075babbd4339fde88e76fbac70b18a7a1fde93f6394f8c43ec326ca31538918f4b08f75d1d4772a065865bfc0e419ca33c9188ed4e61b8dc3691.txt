The Victoria Foundation has launched its 2023 Vital Signs Survey, asking Greater Victoria residents to weigh in on quality of life in the capital region.

This is the 18th annual Victoria survey, which was launched in 2006 to assess feelings about everything from housing to safety and health and wellness.

The 2023 survey opened Tuesday and runs until Friday, June 2. A link is on the Victoria Foundation website.

Residents are invited to fill out either a short or long version of the survey this year, with results set to be released in the fall.

Last year’s survey drew 2,542 responses, including 2,134 online and 408 through panels.

“Every voice counts in a community and we value every response,” said Victoria Foundation chief executive Sandra Richardson, who said the results will paint a picture of “how we’re doing, and what we need to work on together as a community.”

Similar surveys are conducted by community foundations across Canada.

Victoria’s survey uses a five-letter-grade scale, ranging from A for “excellent, stay the course” to F for “poor, immediate action is crucial.”

The 2022 survey pinpointed housing, cost of living and health care as the region’s most important issues, with housing receiving a grade of F — the first time a local issue has received that grade.

The majority of respondents cited a lack of affordable homes to rent or own in the area.

Overall quality of life was given a B-plus, an improvement over the B grades given in 2020 and 2021.

The Victoria Foundation dates back to 1936, making it the second-oldest community foundation in Canada.

It manages charitable gifts from donors and creates permanent, income-earning funds whose proceeds are distributed as grants for charitable or educational purposes. Over $300 million has been invested in a wide range of initiatives over the years.

The 2023 Vital Signs program is sponsored by Coast Capital.
