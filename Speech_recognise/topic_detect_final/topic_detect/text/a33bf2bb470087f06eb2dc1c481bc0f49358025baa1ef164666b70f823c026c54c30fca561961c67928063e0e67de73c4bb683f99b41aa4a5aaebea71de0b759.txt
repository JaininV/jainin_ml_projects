Town hall bosses who are still allowing many of their staff to work from home are receiving bumper pay packets.

Dozens are paid more than £100,000 a year in council buildings where half of desks remain empty.

John O'Connell of the TaxPayers' Alliance, which carried out the audit, said last night: 'Taxpayers facing record council tax rises want to be sure they are getting value for money from their local authority leadership.

'Many authorities continue with extremely generous pay and perks, including bonuses and golden goodbyes, while local people are facing a financial squeeze. Town hall bosses must ensure they are delivering value for residents, including getting staff back to their desks or selling off unused offices.'

The campaign group's annual local government 'rich list' found that at least 2,759 town hall staff were on more than £100,000 last year. Of those, 721 received more than £150,000 – including 608 paid more than the £156,163 salary granted to Rishi Sunak in 2021-22.

Generous pension contributions, bonuses and golden goodbyes were dished out despite town halls insisting that soaring inflation and extra demand for services made council tax rises necessary.

Bills are going up by 5.1 per cent this year, meaning the charge for an average Band D property will top £2,000 for the first time.

The employee with the highest remuneration was an unnamed managing director at Guildford Borough Council, who received £607,633 including a 'termination payment' of £154,240, benefits totalling £5,688 and pension contributions of £339,158.

A spokesman said: 'In the last financial year we made a one-off payment of £154,000 to the former managing director.

'The payment was a legal obligation and reflects over 30 years of loyal service to our borough.

'This payment was shared equally with Waverley Borough Council in line with our partnership agreement.'

Second was Fiona Brown – Sunderland's departing 'executive director of neighbourhoods' – who got a total of £573,550.

A spokesman said: 'We continue to deliver crucial services during the cost of living crisis, including services to thousands of vulnerable adults and children, and are delivering hundreds of millions of pounds of investment that is making Sunderland a more dynamic, healthy and vibrant city.

'This work involves major social and legal responsibilities and remuneration to senior and ex-staff, including pensions and benefits where they have left after long service, can reflect this.'

Third highest-paid was Robert Steenson, North Lanarkshire's executive director for enterprise and communities, who received £536,530 including compensation for loss of office.��

A spokesman for the council said: 'As with any employee, the postholder is entitled to their pension payment and redundancy where a role is made redundant.'

The fourth biggest pay packet went to Sandy Hopkins, who was chief executive of Southampton City Council until last year. She received £406,403 including a £188,239 payoff.

Fifth was Paul Najsarek, who stepped down as Ealing chief executive in 2021 with £325,047 including a £94,859 pay-off.

The TaxPayers' Alliance's surveys of council offices revealed that Westminster had an average occupancy rate of 50 per cent last autumn and 50 employees who were on more than £100,000.

Stoke had the lowest occupancy rate in the country at just 7 per cent – and six staff received more than £100,000.
