Arsenal have received a boost in their interest in VfL Wolfsburg fullback Ridle Baku.

The Germany international has been linked with the Gunners, with VfL willing to sell for around Â£10-15m.

Sky Deutschland's Florian Plettenberg is reporting Baku's 'dream destination' is the Premier League.

Plettenberg also confirms Arsenal are interested in the right-back.

Gunners boss Mikel Arteta has used regular centre-half Ben White this season at fullback.
