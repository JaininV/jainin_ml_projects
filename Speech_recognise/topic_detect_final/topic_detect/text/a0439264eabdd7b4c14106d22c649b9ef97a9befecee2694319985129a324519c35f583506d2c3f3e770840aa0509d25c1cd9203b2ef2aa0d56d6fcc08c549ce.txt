The Directorate of Public Works and Army Community Service on Fort Leonard Wood has planned an event designed to clean up the earth while celebrating volunteers on April 22nd. The National Volunteer Week/Earth Day Event will be held from 8 AM to noon this Saturday. Volunteers can expect team-building exercises, cleaning up the community, and making it an enjoyable place to live and work. Participants are asked to arrive at ACS headquarters, Building 486, by 7:45 AM to sign in. Active-duty service members, their families, retirees, and survivors are all welcome to participate. Volunteers who want to log their volunteer hours can register by calling 573-596-0613. Anyone unable to register by the day of the event can still do so the day of. Open spots are available for those who choose to show up on the day of the event.
