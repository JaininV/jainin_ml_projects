HAL ROBSON-KANU has told Hollywood star Ryan Reynolds he would come out of retirement to play for Wrexham next season.

The ex-Wales forward, 33, has not played a competitive match since scoring in the Premier League for West Brom at Leeds in May 2021.

But Robson-Kanu offered his services for free to A-lister Reynolds.

That’s with Wrexham just one win away from returning to the Football League after a 15-year absence.

Robson-Kanu tweeted: "@vancityreynolds I'll come out of retirement and come and play for @wrexham_afc next season.

"I'll also give my salary to the charity of the fans choosing..."

Robson's Kanu's post was followed by a telephone emoji.

The former Reading front man won 46 caps for Wales and scored a famous 'Cruyff' turn goal in the Euro 2016 quarter-final triumph over Belgium.

Robson-Kanu's offer to play for the National League leaders comes after Ben Foster, 39, also came out of retirement to sign for ambitious Wrexham last month.

The ex-England and Manchester United goalkeeper had called time on his career in September.

But he returned on a deal until the end of the season in a bid to help the Welsh outfit win promotion to League Two.

The Dragons beat Yeovil 3-0 on Tuesday night and that win puts them on the brink of clinching the National League title.

And Phil Parkinson's side are now four points clear of second-placed Notts County with two games remaining.
