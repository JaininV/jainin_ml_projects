A preschool in Portsmouth has got a new space for outdoor activities after a helping hand from local co-operative colleagues.

Southern Co-op colleagues took part in a recent volunteering effort to help clear the green space around the Little Bears Forest Preschool in Portsmouth.

After contacting Portsmouth Parks and Open Spaces about volunteering opportunities, Southern Co-op was informed that Little Bears Forest Preschool had recently taken on the lease from the council for the preschool and needed help with an area to be used for the children’s outdoor activities.

But the area was overgrown with mainly blackthorn and brambles so Southern Co-op colleagues quickly stepped up and organised a team of volunteers to help with the task.

Sarah Ward​, Service Desk Analyst at Southern Co-op, said: “We’re proud to have been able to help Little Bears Forest Preschool and support their mission to provide a safe and engaging learning environment for the children.

“At Southern Co-op, we believe in giving back to the communities that support us, and we’ll continue to seek out opportunities to make a positive impact in Portsmouth and beyond.”

The team worked hard to cut down and clear the area, and the effort will hopefully make a big difference to the teaching and learning outcomes at the preschool.

Based next to Milton Common, the preschool currently looks after around 50 children.

Megan Smith, Deputy Manager at Little Bears Forest Preschool, said: “We are very grateful for the support and help of the volunteers in their efforts to clear the overgrown and littered area. We are thoroughly looking forward to teaching the children here with nature and expanding our offerings. The team of people who came to help were all really lovely and it was great to chat with them. Many thanks to all involved.”
