For the first time this season, a new team entered the WyoPreps Coaches and Media Softball Poll.

After domination by the East Conference, the Cody Fillies from the West Conference crashed the party. That was one of the two changes in the new rankings.

After a split on the road against two ranked opponents last weekend, Cheyenne East lost some first-place votes but maintained the No. 1 spot. The Thunderbirds earned ten of the 19 first-place votes.

The first change involved a pair of rivals at No. 2.

Campbell County garnered five first-place votes after they swept the Thunderbirds and Cheyenne Central at home last weekend. That moved the Camels into a tie for second with Thunder Basin. The Bolts received three first-place votes and enough second and third-place votes for the tie.

Laramie, who has not played in over weeks because of the weather, stayed in fourth.

The second change was at No. 5. Cody picked up the final first-place vote and jumped into that spot.

After a winless weekend on the road in Gillette, Cheyenne Central fell out of the top five.

One note was the poll closed before the two Gillette schools squared off, and Cheyenne East faced Cheyenne Central on Tuesday.
