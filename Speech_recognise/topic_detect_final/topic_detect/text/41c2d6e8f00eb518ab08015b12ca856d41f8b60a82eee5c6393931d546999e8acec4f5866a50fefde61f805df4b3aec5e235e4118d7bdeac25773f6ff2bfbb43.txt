Shocking video has emerged showing the moment a brute smacks an NYPD cop in the head with a bottle â€” before trying to pummel her and her partner.

The new clip, posted on the NYC Scoop Twitter feed, shows the uniformed female cop standing on a busy sidewalk at 231st Street and Broadway in Kingsbridge around 2 p.m. Monday.

Suddenly, 45-year-old Jose Garcia walks up behind her and clocks her on the side of the head with the bottle. He then charges at her and swings at another cop standing next to her before he is taken to the ground by that officer and at least one other person, the footage shows.

Garcia has been arrested and charged with assault, obstruction of governmental administration, resisting arrest, menacing, criminal possession of a weapon, and harassment, according to the report.

The female officer was reportedly taken to St. Barnabas Hospital, where she was treated and determined to be in stable condition.

According to law enforcement officials, Garcia has had 11 prior arrests, though the report did not include details on his previous charges.
