In our most recent Skills Lab webinar we took a deep dive into the Capture step in the GTD workflow. We discussed what makes a leakproof capture tool. We also distinguished between capturing as a behavior and the tools we use to capture. With quizzes, exercises, and practice scenarios, this will be a valuable opportunity to fine-tune your GTD practice.
