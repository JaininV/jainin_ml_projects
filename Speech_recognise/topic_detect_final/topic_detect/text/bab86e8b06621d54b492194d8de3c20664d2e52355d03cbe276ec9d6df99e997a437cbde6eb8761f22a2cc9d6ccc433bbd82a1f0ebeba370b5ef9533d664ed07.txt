Last night, I had the chance to see Orville Peck in concert at Old Forester's Paristown Hall in Louisville. In case you're unfamiliar, Orville is a alt-country star whose sound will take you back in time and remind you of some of your favorite country icons.Â  Orville lists all sorts of country legends as inspiration- Waylon Jennings, Dolly Parton, Tammy Wynette, Willie Nelson, George Jones and Reba. But, for me, he most reminds me of Johnny Cash. His voice is rolling in the deep. His storytelling is vibrant and layered. And his vibe is thought-provoking and sexy as hell.

Orville, though not at all mainstream, has been flirting with it recently. He's currently serving as a judge/mentor (alongside Jimmie Allen and Mickey Guyton) on the Apple+ series My Kind of Country.

He was also a guest judge on the most recent season (Season 15) of RuPaul's Drag Race.

If you've never heard Orville sing, I am sharing a couple of my favorite songs of his to give you a bit of a primer. The first, "Daytona Sand" shows off Orville's vibe and storytelling I talked about.

The next- "Let Me Drown"- shows off his incredible voice. Don't let that big, deep voice make you think that's all he's got. Orville's range is INSANE and on full display in this live performance from Nashville. This song is haunting, painful and moving.

Needless to say, I was pumped to get the chance to see Orville in concert in Louisville. About 2000 Orville fans were at Old Forester's Paristown Hall with me last night. Here are some of my favorite photos from the event.

As expected, Orville was incredible- one of those rare artists who sounds just as good live as he does in person. I was a fan going into the show. I left a stan. I am exactly what Orville described right before he laid into his encore song. I am forever a card-carrying member of the club.
