British law enforcement officials released a photo of an alleged perpetrator who broke into a car and stole a Louis Vuitton bag and a MacBook.

The photo has gone viral because the man in it looks like Prince Harry.

“Here it is, a rare photo of Harry without Meghan,” social media users immediately commented ironically on the photo.

The Mirror reports that the photo was taken by a CCTV camera and, according to police, it depicts a man linked to the crime.

Along with a designer bag and a laptop, headphones and a disc containing “important information” disappeared from the car. What information is in question – in the interests of the investigation has not yet been reported.

Earlier the ‘regional leader’ explained why Prince Harry didn’t have time to say goodbye to his grandmother.
