The project is rising on the corner of Dakota and MLK.

Apartment plans go back to 2015 for a corner development site at   2950 S. Dakota St. in Columbia City. An LLC associated with Bode acquired the vacant parking lot in 2016 for a little over $1 million. Rutledge Maul Architects later took the three- and four-story, 80-unit plan through design review. A master use permit followed in 2020.
