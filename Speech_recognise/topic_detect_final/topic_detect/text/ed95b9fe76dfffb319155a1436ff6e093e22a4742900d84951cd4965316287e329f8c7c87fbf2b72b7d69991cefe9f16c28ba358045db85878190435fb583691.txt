Jean-Paul Sartre was a prominent philosopher in the 20th century who sought to understand the nature of human consciousness and experience. One of his key concepts was "nihilation," which he famously illustrated using the figure/ground analysis of a café in his work "Being and Nothingness."

In this analysis, Sartre describes a person sitting in a café, observing the objects around them, such as tables, chairs, and other people. These objects form the "figure" of the experience, or what is in the foreground of the person's awareness. However, Sartre argues that there is also a "ground" to the experience, which is the person's own consciousness. This consciousness is not an object in the world like the tables and chairs, but rather the "nothingness" or "negativity" that allows the objects to appear in the first place.

Sartre writes, "Consciousness is a being such that in its being, its being is in question in so far as this being implies a being other than itself" (Sartre, "Being and Nothingness," p. 60). In other words, consciousness is always aware of something other than itself, and this awareness necessitates a kind of self-negation or "nihilation." Sartre argues that this nihilation is an essential aspect of consciousness and experience, as it allows for the objects of the world to appear in consciousness.

This argument shows that nihilation is not just a grammatical or logical point, but an originary part of experience. Sartre writes, "It is not we who make a separation between consciousness and being; on the contrary, this separation is essential to the existence of consciousness" (p. 66). In other words, the separation between consciousness and being is not something that we choose to do, but rather a necessary condition for consciousness to exist at all. This implies that nihilation is not something that can be overcome or eliminated, but rather a fundamental aspect of human experience.

Overall, Sartre's figure/ground analysis of a café is a powerful illustration of the concept of nihilation. By showing how consciousness is always aware of something other than itself, Sartre demonstrates that nihilation is an essential part of human experience. This argument also shows that nihilation is not just a grammatical or logical point, but a fundamental aspect of consciousness itself.
