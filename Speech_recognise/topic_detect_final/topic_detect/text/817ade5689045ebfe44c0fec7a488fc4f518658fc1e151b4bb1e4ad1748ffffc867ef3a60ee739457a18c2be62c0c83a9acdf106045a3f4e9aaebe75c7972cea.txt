The Cannes International Film Festival will premiere new films from influential British filmmakers Jonathan Glazer and Ken Loach, as well as Japanese Palme d’Or winner Hirokazu Kore-eda, as part of its 2023 festival line-up.

Announced by general delegate Thierry Frémaux and incoming president Iris Knobloch during a press conference from Paris, France on Thursday 13th April, the 2023 Cannes International Film Festival will also debut new films from Todd Haynes, Wes Anderson and Wim Wenders.

Of the films listed to be in competition at the festival, six have been directed by women. This is a new record. Press and visitors can expect new films from former Palme d’Or-nominated directors Alice Rohrwacher (Happy as Lazzaro) and Jessica Hausner (Little Joe) among others.

The opening film of the festival will be Jeanne du Barry from French actress and director Maïwenn, about the last official mistress of Louis XV (set to be played by Johnny Depp).

Jeanne du Barry will be presented out of competition alongside  Killers of the Flower Moon, Kim Jee-won’s Cobweb, Sam Levinson’s The Idol, and James Mangold’s Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.

There will also be a special screening of the latest film from British filmmaker Steve McQueen (), Occupied City, a documentary about life in Amsterdam, Netherlands during the Nazi occupation of World War II.

The debut of Jonathan Glazer’s adaptation of Martin Amis’ “The Zone of Interest” will mark the first feature release by the Sexy Beast director since 2013’s critically-acclaimed Under the Skin. The Zone of Interest tells of a Nazi officer falling in love with the wife of the commander of the Auschwitz concentration camp and will star  Sandra Hüller.

Meanwhile,  director Ken Loach will debut his first film since before to the pandemic. The British filmmaker, last at Cannes with Sorry We Missed You, directed Palme d’Or winners The Wind that Shakes the Barley (2006) and  (2016). His latest film, The Old Oak, will see him reunite with screenwriter Paul Laverty to tell of the tensions between UK immigrants and the small north east village they are housed in.

Hirokazu Kore-eda, whose films have been nominated for the Palme d’Or six times, is another former Palme d’Or winner () returning to the south of France in 2023. Kore-eda’s latest film, Monster, is currently being kept top secret, though it will reunite the Japanese director with his Shoplifters star Sakura Ando.

The only other Palme d’Or winner to return in 2023 will be Turkish filmmaker Nuri Bilge Ceylan, whose film Winter Sleep won the prestigious award in 2014. Ceylan also won Best Director at Cannes in 2008 for Winter Sleep.
