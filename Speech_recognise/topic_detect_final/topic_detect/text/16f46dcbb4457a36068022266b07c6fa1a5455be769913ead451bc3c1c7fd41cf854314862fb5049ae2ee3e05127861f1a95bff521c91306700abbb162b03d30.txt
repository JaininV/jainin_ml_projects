Learn how your daughter can begin her Girl Scout Journey!

Right now, Girl Scouts are meeting furry friends at the local animal shelters, giggling past lights-out at sleepovers, and learning how their favorite roller coasters work. Above all else, they're having a blast-because they know bringing the fun is all about being their true selves, trying new things, and cheering each other on.

New friends. New adventures. The best is yet to come! Shine bright with Girl Scouts and discover a whole new world of possibilities!

Do you have a Pre K, kindergarten or first-grade daughter who wants to be a Girl Scout Daisy? Join us for an information session in your area where we'll provide you with details on how your girl can become a part of the largest girl-led organization in the world!
