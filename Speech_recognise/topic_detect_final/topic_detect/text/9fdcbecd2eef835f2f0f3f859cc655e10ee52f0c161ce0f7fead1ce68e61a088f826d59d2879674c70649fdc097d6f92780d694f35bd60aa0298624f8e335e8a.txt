The seasons come and go at different times of the year depending upon where you live—Northern Hemisphere or Southern Hemisphere and the latitude within those regions.

Early spring might start in February in Southern California and early May in Maine. The closer you live to the equator the less winter temperatures will play a role in planting and harvesting—and crop selection.

In the mid-Northern Hemisphere, early winter arrives in December and late winter arrives in February; summer arrives in June and comes to a close in late August. In the mid-Southern Hemisphere, early summer arrives in December and late summer comes to an end in late February.

Think of each season–spring, summer, autumn, and winter–as lasting about 90 days; you can then divide each season into its early, mid-, and late periods. For example, early summer in New York State starts in early June and mid-summer starts in early July—early summer last about 30 days.

Tracking temperature averages and day length for a year or two where you live will help you localize your seasonal calendar.
