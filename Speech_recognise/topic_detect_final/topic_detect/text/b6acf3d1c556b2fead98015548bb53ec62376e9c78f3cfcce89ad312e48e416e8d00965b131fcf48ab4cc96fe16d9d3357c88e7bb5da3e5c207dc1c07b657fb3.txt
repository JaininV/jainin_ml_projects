According to the report, PACT helped divert 445 people who may have otherwise ended up in an emergency department and 68 people from ending up in the criminal justice system — a combined total of 513 diversions. In 2021, 407 total diversions were attributed to PACT.

In the report, police note the diversions from hospitals particularly means cost-savings to the Saskatchewan Health Authority and relieves pressure on front line health staff. When it comes to diversions from the criminal justice system, police say in the report that the diversions prevent the criminalization of mental illness and contributes to de-stigmatizing mental health in the community.

Within each PACT, one police officer and one mental health social worker from Saskatoon Crisis Intervention Service are paired and they respond to calls relating to mental health and/or addictions. PACT dispatches have been increasing since 2019 — when it responded to 949 calls.  PACT additionally handles mental health warrants; last year they responded to 329.  At present, there are three PACTs, which each work a four-day rotation of two day shifts and two evening shifts. Saskatoon police want to add a fourth team, which would mean full coverage for its patrol platoons.  “In the absence of a fourth team, mental health related calls are dispatched to general patrol officers. Due to pressures on patrol resources, and in the absence of crisis worker partners, specialized training and expertise, we do not experience the same diversionary outcomes in comparison to when PACT is utilized,” the report reads.

For two of the three PACTs, police receive funding from the Saskatchewan government for the two police positions and funding for the crisis worker positions from the SHA. The police and the crisis worker positions in the third team are funded by the Saskatoon Police Service.  The Vulnerable Persons Unit also oversees the Saskatoon HUB and Crime Free Multi-Housing.  The report is set to be discussed at Thursday’s meeting.             Saskatoon police in discussions with province for more money         The news seems to be flying at us faster all the time.
