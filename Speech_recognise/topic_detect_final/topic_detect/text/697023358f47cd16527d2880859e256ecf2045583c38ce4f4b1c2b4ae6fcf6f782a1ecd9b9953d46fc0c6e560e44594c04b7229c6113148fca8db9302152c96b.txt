Riviera River Cruises is offering Canadian travel advisors a little incentive to book their clients on its 2023 European river cruises.

Effective immediately through the month of May, Riviera will accept bookings for 2023 departures in CAD equivalent to prices listed in USD, providing significant savings through the exchange rate.

Marilyn Conroy, Riviera River Cruises’ Executive Vice President Sales and Marketing North America, said: “Through next month, we’re offering an incentive exclusively to our travel advisor partners to the north – bookings in Canadian dollars on par with U. S. dollars. We’re always supportive of advisors, only accepting bookings from them, and with current exchange rates, this is a great opportunity for their clients to save on our European river cruises right now.”

For example, with the incentive, a Blue Danube river cruise with a price of $2,929 USD per person booked at $2,929 CAD results in savings of about $766 USD or $1,037 CAD based on the exchange rate on April 10.
