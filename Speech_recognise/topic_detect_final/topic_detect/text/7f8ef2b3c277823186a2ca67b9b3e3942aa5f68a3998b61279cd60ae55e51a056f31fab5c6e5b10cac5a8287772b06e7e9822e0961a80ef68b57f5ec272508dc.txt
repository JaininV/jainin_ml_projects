The National Working Committee, NWC, of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, on Tuesday, said embattled Senator George Thompson Sekibo and Rt. Hon Austin Adiele Opara, were not individually and separately suspended by the party contrary to the rumour making the rounds.

It also said the purported suspension by the executive of Ward 2 of the Ogu/Bolo Local Council Area and Ward 10 of Port Harcourt City Local Government Area of Rivers State was false and should be disregarded.

The party’s spokesman, Debo Ologunagba disclosed this in a statement in Abuja to newsmen.

The apex organ of the party said the action of the ward helmsmen, which bordered on indiscipline, was null and void and of no effect since it was not in line with the provisions of the constitution of the party as amended in 2017.

The NWC affirmed that Section 57 (7) provides that notwithstanding any other provision relating to discipline, no Executive Committee, at any level except the National Executive Committee, shall entertain any question of discipline as may relate to or concern a member of the National Executive Committee, Deputy Governor or member of the National Assembly.

Part of the statement reads: “The NWC, therefore, charges all leaders, critical stakeholders, members, teeming supporters of our party in Rivers State and the general public to disregard the purported suspension of Senator George Thompson Sekibo and Rt. Hon. Dr. Austin Adiele Opara.”
