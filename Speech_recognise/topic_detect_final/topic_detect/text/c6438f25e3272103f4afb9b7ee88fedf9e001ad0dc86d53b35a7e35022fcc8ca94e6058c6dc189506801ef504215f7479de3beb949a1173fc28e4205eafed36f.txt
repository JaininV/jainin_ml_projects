The Ontario Health Coalition plans to hold a citizen-led referendum across Ontario next month, where the question being asked will be, “Do you want our public hospital services to be privatized to for-profit hospitals and clinics?”  The Grey Bruce County Health Coalition is the local branch of the provincial coalition, whose various chapters are holding launch events across the province on Tuesday.  Norah Beatty of Meaford, who co-chairs the local group along with Brenda Scott of Chesley, said they only recently organized and are looking for others who want to become involved. They hope to conduct the campaign in as many towns as possible in Grey-Bruce.

“The focus for this campaign is really the privatization of the hospitals in Ontario,” Beatty said. “Ford is creating private for-profit clinics he is calling them, but in essence those clinics are replacing services that are currently in our public hospitals.”  Beatty said they are looking for volunteers to be part of the vote, planned for May 26 and 27.  “If we are going to have polls in Owen Sound we are going to need a lot more volunteers,” Beatty said, adding that with Tuesday���s launch they hope that helps to get the word out and garner more volunteers.

Local voting locations for the referendum will be distributed with the leaflets.

The coalition hopes to garner more than 1 million votes in its referendum provincewide “to make it politically impossible for the Ford government to implement its plans.”  Beatty said those they talk to have expressed support for their campaign. She said they have already distributed about 800 of their leaflets in the Meaford area, with plans to distribute about 22,000 across Grey-Bruce.  On Tuesday, a launch event is planned at Queen’s Park by the Ontario-wide and Greater Toronto Area Health Coalition, as well as in numerous other communities, including Brampton, North Bay, Sault Ste. Marie, Barrie, London, Kitchener, Windsor, Chatham, Petrolia, Peterborough, Kingston, Haliburton, Cornwall, St. Catharines, Hamilton and more.

In January, Premier Doug Ford announced that the government planned to significantly expand the use of for-profit private providers to perform public health services. Ford said at the time that the move was to help relieve the strain on hospitals, which were overwhelmed during the COVID-19 pandemic, but have continued to be stretched as the pandemic has waned.  The government said it planned to add 14,000 cataract surgeries a year, about 25 per cent of the current wait list, and invest $18 million in existing private centres to fund medical imaging and certain surgeries.  The government introduced Bill 60, Your Health Act in February, expanding the role of private clinics to allow them to conduct cataract surgeries, MRI and CT scans, minimally invasive gynecological surgeries, and eventually, knee and hip replacements. The bill is currently being debated at third reading.

The Ontario coalition issued a news release on Friday that said the government had contracted the first three for-profit clinics in Windsor, Waterloo and Ottawa and was allowing for-profit corporations to run surgeries out of under-used public hospital operating rooms.  It said the Ford government had used its majority to “push through” Bill 60 and vote down all amendments proposed by the Opposition parties. The legislation was expected to pass this week.  “The Health Coalition has vowed an unprecedented fightback to match the unprecedented privatization of Ontario’s core public health care services,” it said in the coalition release. “The Ontario public has never had any say about this plan to cut these vital services from our local public hospitals and privatize them.  “Most of our communities have spent the last 100 years or more fundraising, donating and volunteering to build up their local hospitals and bring services closer to home.”  The coalition says private clinics do not create a single new staff person and make staff shortages worse. It fears that soon every service that can be removed from public hospitals will be and only unprofitable services will remain.
