The Curve Cut is inspired by one of history's most iconic hairstyles – Jennifer Aniston’s The Rachel – that took hair salons across the world by storm throughout the 1990s thanks to Aniston’s star role in Friends.

Taking inspiration from the soft shape of the Rachel, the Curve Cut, also known as the C Shape Cut, is a cut featuring layered lengths, allowing it to frame the face and making it easy to wear and personalize.

The term Curve Cut is so-called due to the way the style “curves” around the face. The layers are cut and the ends are styled in such a way as to create natural curves. Hairstyles layered in this way can add volume to your locks without weighing it down. Compared to other cuts, such as the Cub Cut, the Curve Cut uses its lengths and tips to give a softer look that’s less angular and geometric.

While the Curve Cut allows for easy airdrying, 1990s-style blowout will bring out a beautiful effect, as seen on supermodels. If this is what you’re looking for, then in order to add volume and curls at the tips, you’ll want to arm yourself with both a round hairbrush and a heated brush.

This layered hairstyle lends itself well to being personalized. Requiring shoulder-length hair, the lengths must be cut at different lengths in order to give a volumizing effect. Your styling technique can also influence the look of the cut – the ends can be turned inwards to create a perfect C shape, or the locks can be kept forward on the face, the tips touching the jaw then flicking outwards.
