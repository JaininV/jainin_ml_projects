Jones, who is 21, is considered to be one of the best offensive linemen in this year's draft class standing at 6-foot-5, 311 pounds. He ranks as Pro Football Focus' No. 26 overall prospect and the fifth-best O-lineman.

"Jones is a bully of an offensive tackle. You're not going through him, you'll have to go around," PFF writes.

The Steelers need an upgrade at left tackle and Jones could be an immediate plug-and-play option.

Bresee, who is also 21, ranks as PFF's No. 21 overall prospect and and third-best defensive lineman on its big board. The 6-foot-5, 298 pound D-lineman totaled 51 tackles, nine sacks, one forced fumble and one interception from 2020-22.

"He can really move and is even capable of playing outside the tackles," PFF writes.

Pittsburgh's aging defensive line could use a splash of youth and Bresee might be a perfect fit.

It's quite possible the Steelers could end up with both players as well. With pick Nos. 17 and 32, all it takes is one falling slightly past their ranking for Pittsburgh to land Jones and Bresee.
