While some dogs are easier to train than others, sometimes it’s the trainer who could use training.

Great dog trainers share certain traits, like patience, discipline and consistency. But other qualities are just as important. For example, the ability to really listen and adapt to each dog is key. That requires real-time collaboration with a dog and the ability to tweak methods on the fly and make it fun.

Some canine behavioral experts use parenting styles to evaluate methods of dog training. An authoritative style — that’s firm but kind and adaptable — best fosters canine persistence and attachment. That’s in contrast to a permissive style, which doesn’t set clear expectations, or an authoritarian style, which emphasizes firmness over warmth.

So, if your dog flunked obedience class, perhaps Fido isn’t the only one to blame.
