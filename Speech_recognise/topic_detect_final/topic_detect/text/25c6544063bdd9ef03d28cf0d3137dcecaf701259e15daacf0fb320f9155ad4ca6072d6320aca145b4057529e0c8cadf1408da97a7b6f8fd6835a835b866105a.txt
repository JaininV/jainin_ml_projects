Not long after the actor spoke about how he’d be appearing in the new DC Universe, Frank Grillo‘s role in James Gunn’s DCU has been revealed.

The Wrap has reported that Grillo will be playing Rick Flag Sr. in the upcoming animated series Creature Commandos. The series is set to be the first project of the new DCU, as it currently has a 2024 release window. Just recently, Gunn stated that the show had started production and was almost done with the casting process.

The character of Rick Flag Sr. first appeared in Secret Origins #14 in 1987 and was created by John Ostrander and Luke McDonnell. Joel Kinnaman played the character’s son, Rick Flag Jr., in both 2016’s Suicide Squad and 2021’s The Suicide Squad, which took place in the modern day.

The DC Universe’s first phase, called Chapter One: Gods and Monsters, will feature a multitude of different movies and television shows. A few of the announced projects include Superman: Legacy, a Batman and Robin-focused movie called The Brave and the Bold, a Supergirl movie titled Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow, a Swamp Thing film, and multiple TV shows.
