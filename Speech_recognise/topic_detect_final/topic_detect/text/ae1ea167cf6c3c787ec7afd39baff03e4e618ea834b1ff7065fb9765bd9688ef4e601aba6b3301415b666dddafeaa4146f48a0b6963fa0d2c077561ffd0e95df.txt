Rich and heavy soil. Improve the soil texture by incorporating bulky organic matter, such as garden compost or well-rotted manure, to boost the plants’ growth rate and cropping, while reducing the chances of bolting.

Water regularly, especially if weather is dry.

Protect spinach plants from slugs and snails by making mulch barriers at the base of young plants. Alternatively, apply a nematode-based biological control after sowing.

You can mulch with either sugar-cane mulch or pea straw when the plants have grown to around 3–5cm tall.

Choose a sunny or part-shaded spot and fork in some well-rotted manure. Sow the seed along a prewetted drill, 1.5-2cm deep, 30cm between rows. Cover and water so the soil is just moist.

Thin out the seedlings at regular intervals, removing the more congested and weaker plants, to a final spacing of about 15cm.

After thinning, water well to resettle the soil around the roots. Keeping the soil moist not only decreases the risk of plants bolting, but produces more tender, succulent leaves.

Spinach is ready to harvest 6-10 weeks after sowing, and growth is quickest during warmer weather. Use a sharp knife to avoid pulling the plants and loosening them in the ground.

* Strawberries, peas and beans are great companion plants to grow with spinach. The peas and beans are ideal as they provide shade for the growing leaves.

* Choose a sheltered spot with moisture-retentive soil, and try to avoid hotter and drier sites as these conditions will increase the risk of the plants bolting and running to seed.

* Sow spinach in punnets for planting out when 5-8cm tall, if you prefer not to direct sow.

* Create temporary shade if weather conditions turn very hot to reduce the risk of bolting and to produce a more tender leaf, growth may be slower and harvest times will take a little longer.

* Keep in mind that in the extreme cold, growth may be slow.
