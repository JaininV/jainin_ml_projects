Wildman started on covers, then interiors on the Marvel UK Transformers comics run, and has been involved in Transformers stories since, through Dreamwave and IDW, all the way to the final issue of ReGeneration One.

He currently works predominantly on storyboarding for TV and film, for the likes of Doctor Who, Luther (including recent film The Fallen Sun), while keeping at personal creator-owned comics projects, Horizon and Oxygen. Most recently, his art – along with that of John Paul Bove and Steven Baskerville – has graced the 2022 Royal Mail Transformers stamp series.
