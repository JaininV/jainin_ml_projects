Tallahassee, FL - A Florida middle school teacher is facing charges for allegedly facilitating organized fights in her classroom and allowing students to fight during school hours.

According to court documents, 23-year-old Angel Footman, a teacher at Griffin Middle School in Tallahassee, is facing charges for allegedly contributing to the delinquency of a minor by facilitating organized fights in her classroom.

On March 24th, a School Resource Deputy was alerted that students were being allowed to fight in Footman's classroom.

School administrators were shown videos that purportedly showed several fights taking place between March 22nd and March 23rd.

Several sixth-grade girls told detectives that they participated in planned fights during school hours and alleged that they were invited back for additional fights.

They also reported that Footman made statements such as "30 seconds, no screaming, no yelling, no phones."

A detective reviewed the videos and identified Footman sitting at her desk, failing to intervene, and making statements like "no screaming, no nothing" and "stop pulling hair."

According to court documents obtained by WCTV, there are no records of Footman reporting the fights to administrators.

During the investigation, Footman told investigators that she did not organize the fights but admitted to failing to call for help or take quick action to stop the altercations or report them to administrators.

She now faces four counts of contributing to the delinquency of a minor.

An arraignment for Footman is scheduled for May 4th.
