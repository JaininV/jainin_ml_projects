In the opener of their first-round playoff series Saturday night, the Sacramento Kings and Golden State Warriors put together a sequence that summed up the NBA of 2023—a season in 15 seconds.

With just over four minutes remaining in a one-point game, Golden State’s Stephen Curry caught a pass at the deepest corner of the court and dropped a 3-pointer over the corner of the backboard, flipping the lead. Kings guard De’Aaron Fox immediately sped down the floor, caught a pass on the wing and tossed in a triple of his own to get it back.
