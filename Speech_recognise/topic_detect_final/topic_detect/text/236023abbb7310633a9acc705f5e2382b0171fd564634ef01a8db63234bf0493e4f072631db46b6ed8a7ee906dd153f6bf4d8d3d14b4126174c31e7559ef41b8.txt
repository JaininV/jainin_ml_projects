Before you hire security camera installation Miami FL, you have to decide whether you want a wireless security camera or a wired one. To take the best decision, you need to know the differences between wireless and wired cameras along with a list of their pros and cons. The main difference between wireless and wired cameras is that the former doesnâ€™t come with a wire while the latter does.

A wireless or wire-free security camera can send video footage through wireless connectivity, such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. As soon as Wi-Fi gets the signal, it sends the footage immediately to the cloud server. These cameras are mainly powered by batteries.

On the other hand, wired security cameras can successfully transmit any video footage along with audio signals with the help of a wire to the control center. These cameras get their power from a power outlet through a cable or wire.

Here are some of the advantages and disadvantages of wireless security cameras:

* Flexible use of the security system

* Not possible to hack into the system
