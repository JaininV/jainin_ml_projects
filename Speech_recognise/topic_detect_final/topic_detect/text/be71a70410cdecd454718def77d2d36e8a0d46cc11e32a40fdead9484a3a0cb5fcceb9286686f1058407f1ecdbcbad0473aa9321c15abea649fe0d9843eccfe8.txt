Former Jammu and Kashmir Deputy Chief Minister Muzaffar Hussain Beigh on Sunday rejected  the claim made by former J&K Governor Satyapal Malik that the former had told Malik that the late separatist leader Syed Ali Geelani was ready to talk to him on Kashmir.

Beigh stated that Malik’s memory had weakened due to his age. He denied the claims made by Malik that he and other mainstream politicians had met  Geelani.

“I met Malik once and there was a brief chat between us. But there was no mention of Geelani in the meeting,” Baig told a local news agency KNS.

“Since I took part in assembly elections in Jammu and Kashmir, I have never met Geelani. He considered us (mainstream politicians) as untouchables. There was a time when we took part in elections, Geelani issued social boycott call against us,” he added.

“The former J&K Governor is currently going through that stage of life where his memory has got weaken,” Beige said.
