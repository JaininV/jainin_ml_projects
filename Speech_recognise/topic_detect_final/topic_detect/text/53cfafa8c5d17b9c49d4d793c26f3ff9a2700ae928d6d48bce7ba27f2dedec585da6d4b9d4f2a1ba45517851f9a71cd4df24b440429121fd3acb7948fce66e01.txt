True to his name, Tank (ID: A002233) is a big guy! This 3-year-old weighs about 60 pounds. He is as friendly with other dogs as he is with people, enjoying a game of chase in shelter playgroups. He sits and shakes on command, and he takes treats gently. He is strong and pulls a little on the leash at first, but is generally easy to walk. Tank appears house-trained and will rest quietly in a crate. He’s also done well with children in the past. He doesn’t always like to share his snacks, though, so he should be left to enjoy them on his own. If this handsome hunk sounds like a good fit for your home, make an appointment with Pasco County Animal Services today to meet him!

Janine (ID: A007263) is a snuggly, wiggly gal with a sweet, soft temperament. She can be a little timid at times, but is affectionate with her people. She also enjoys games of chase with other dogs and walks well on a leash. Janine can make her own fun when she’s bored, but crating her when she’s alone could help. This 3-year-old weighs about 55 pounds, but could stand to gain a few more. She did test positive for heartworms, and Pasco County Animal Services staff would be happy to discuss treatment options with you. Janine had a rough start to life and is looking for someone who can make her future bright. If that’s you, come down to the shelter and meet her today!
