The head of the UN Development Programme reportedly told Afghanistan’s Khaama Press that if it can’t convince the Taliban to let local women work for the institution, the UN is prepared to depart Afghanistan in May.

The UN is attempting to work out an exception to a Taliban order that forbids local women from working for the organisation.

According to Achin Steiner, administrator of the UNDP, “it is fair to say that where we are right now requires the entire United Nations system to step back and re-evaluate its capacity to operate there.” But the point is not to compromise on fundamental principles like human rights.

According to Nangarhar, Afghanistan-based Khaama Press, the United Nations has expressed “serious concerns” after Afghan female UN staff employees were prohibited from reporting to work in the eastern region of Afghanistan.

The UN warned the Taliban that without female personnel, life-saving supplies would be at risk because women make up the bulk of the organization’s employees.

According to Khaama Press, the UN stated on Twitter that without female personnel, its organisations “cannot operate and deliver life-saving assistance.”

International organisations, such as the UN, have frequently voiced their worries over the exclusion of women from the assistance industry, stating that without female workers, the organisations will be unable to reach needy women.

The Taliban has banned women and girls from receiving an education and working since taking power in Afghanistan in August 2021.

The Taliban initially forbade girls from continuing their education past the sixth grade; a directive prohibiting Afghan women from pursuing higher education and working with both domestic and foreign NGOs was issued in December 2022.

According to Khaama Press, national and international organisations have criticised the oppressive laws on women harshly and warned that they will prevent the most vulnerable Afghan citizens from receiving humanitarian relief.
