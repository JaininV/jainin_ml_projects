Trance, Trauma is a Rusty Lake style point and click puzzle game where you attempt to unravel the tragic events that led to a woman’s suicide.

In Trance, Trauma you find yourself locked in a room with a dead body hanging from the roof. You need to search the room, look for clues and solve puzzles as you attempt to figure out who the woman is and why she killed herself. The full game will feature three hexagonal rooms to explore, while the demo takes place in the first one.

It’s certainly a macabre premise for a game but aside from the hanging dead body, it’s not too grim an experience and the mystery is certainly intriguing. The puzzles are also satisfyingly tricky, you’ll need a notebook and pen for this one!
