Since establishing the Africa Program in 2007, The Nature Conservancy’s vision in Africa is to work towards fostering a sustainable future for people and nature, partnering with indigenous communities, governments, and the private sector across more than 22 million hectares on the continent. Our efforts are firmly rooted in people, leveraging scientific and technical expertise as we collaborate with key stakeholders to conserve and enhance Africa’s shared resources in the countries we operate. Together with our partners, we are witnessing critical milestones in integrated land and fisheries management, ocean and source water protection, energy development, and sustainable food production working together and strengthening our resolve in tackling global challenges such as climate change, habitat, and biodiversity loss that stand to adversely impact the nearly 1.4 billion people that share Africa.
