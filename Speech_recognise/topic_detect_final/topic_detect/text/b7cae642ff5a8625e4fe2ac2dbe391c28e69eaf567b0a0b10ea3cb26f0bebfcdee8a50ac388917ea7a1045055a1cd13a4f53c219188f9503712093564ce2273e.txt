Rick Georges Substack Newsletter. A good friend who subscribes to my SubStack Newsletter said some nice things and offered to pay for access to the FutureLawyer. I have never charged for the blog or other social media; but, it occurred to me that some of you might appreciate being able to have direct contact via email and chat. So, for $8 a month, or $80 a year, you can subscribe to the SubStack Newsletter which will contain all the free stuff I publish, plus some extras, and direct access to me via email and chat. Any question about legal technology, software, poetry, philosophy, or whatever, will get a personal reply. It is scary to put myself out there like this; but, I have never been accused of being a shrinking violet. If you are interested, head on over to Substack, and find Rick Georges. I am there every day.
