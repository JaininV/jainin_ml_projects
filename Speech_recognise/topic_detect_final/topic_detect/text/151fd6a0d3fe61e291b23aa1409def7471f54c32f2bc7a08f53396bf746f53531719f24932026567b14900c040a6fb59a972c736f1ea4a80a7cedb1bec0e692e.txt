The digging crane that was stolen in Knokke-Heist last week has been found. The machine was recovered in Eeklo, next to the N49, the Knokke-Antwerp express road. Peter De Sloovere of construction firm PDS Bouw from Knokke-Heist is happy to have his mini-excavator back, especially as it is not really damaged.

The small excavator disappeared during works on the Kragen Dike in Knokke-Heist (West Flanders). The machine was recovered a few days later thanks to a tip-off from a witness and the detective work of the local police, who studied camera images.

Peter De Sloovere of construction firm PDS Bouw went to collect the mini-excavator from towing services in Eeklo (East Flanders). "I am grateful to the police because I got the excavator back so quickly. I really need the machine a lot. In fact, I am on my way to a yard with it now. Fortunately, the crane has not been damaged very much. The stickers have been pulled off and itâ€™s bent here and there. But it starts well and works as it should."

The investigation into who stole the equipment is ongoing. An examining judge is working on the case.
