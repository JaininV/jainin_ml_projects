Here is a quick look at what the Barton County Commission did Wednesday morning:

• Heard a presentation on the Wall That Heals from Larry Parson, chairperson for The Wall That Heals/Great Bend Leadership Committee. This is  a three-quarter scale replica of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial along with a mobile Education Center coming to Great Bend May 11-14.

The Wall will be located at Veterans Memorial Park’s Al Burns Field, and will be open 24 hours a day and free to the public, Parsons said.

Persistent dry weather conditions have created a fire hazard situation within Barton County, said Emergency Risk Manager Amy Miller.  Local fire chiefs have asked that the commission prohibit open burning in Barton County by declaring a temporary burn ban until conditions improve.

–   Michael G. Davis has requested $9,673.72 in grant funding to improve the building located at 158 S. Main, Hoisington. The building houses Cardinal Thrift Store. The $3,224.57 match by the applicant equates to 25% of the project.

– Colby Miller said  Millers of Claflin Inc. has requested $20,000 in grant funding to improve the building located at 220 Main, Claflin.  The $19,122.98 match by the applicant equates to 49% of the project.

– Grant and Shannon Unruh have requested $20,000 in grant funding to improve the building located at 1110 Main, Great Bend. The building houses Mitchell’s Bakery.

The $15,650.34 match by the applicant equates to 44% of the project.

• Held a discussion of the South Central Kansas Association of Commissioners and Engineers meeting that took place last Thursday and Friday in Hutchinson.

Commissioners Duane Reif and Donna Zimmerman attended the SCKACE meeting and they led a discussion on information presented.

• Approved a Courthouse HVAC improvement project lease agreement with Concept Commercials LLC for property at 1520 Main for a $4.62-per-square-foot flat rate. The building will house the Barton County Attorney’s Office.

• Approved the return of $26,296.81 COVID-19 grant funding awarded to the Barton County Health Department.

A review of grant reports by the Health Department indicate that certain remaining funding must be remitted back to Health and Human Services since the federal grant period had lapsed, County Administrator Matt Patzner said.

• Held a 15-minute executive session to discuss matters of attorney-client privilege regarding possible litigation involving the county. In the session were the commission, County Administrator Matt Patzner and County Counselor Patrick Hoffman.

No action was taken when the commission reconvened in open session.

• Heard statements from Central Kansas Community Corrections Director Amy Boxberger in response to Barton County Sheriff Brian Bellendir’s remarks at last week’s commission meeting that her office was allowing unlimited positive drug tests and not holding offenders accountable.
