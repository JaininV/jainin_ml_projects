BIRMINGHAM — Birmingham police are investigating the second homicide of the day, according to Officer Truman Fitzgerald.

Truman said officers responded to a call of a person shot on Monday at 6:40 p.m. in the 1900 block of Huntington Lane. Police arrived and found a young adult male suffering from gunshot wounds. Birmingham Fire and Rescue pronounced the victim deceased.

“The preliminary investigation revealed that a small party was being held at the residence,” Fitzgerald said. “The victim and suspect were in a room when all of the sudden party goers heard shots being fired. The suspect fled the scene and is not in custody.”

Investigators were on the scene speaking to witnesses and gathering information as the investigation continues.

Just before 5 a.m. on Monday, a 28-year-old man was reported shot and killed in Birmingham.
