Hundreds of Orthodox Christians lined up outside a cathedral in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, after a service on Sunday as they waited for a priest to bless them with a spray of water as part of an Easter tradition.

They carried baskets packed with candles, delicately dyed eggs, paskha cake, chunks of cured pork fat known as salo, and sweet Ukrainian wine called Kagor. As the priest came down the line, some flinched or burst into giggles as the water caught their faces.

Alisa Kupchyn, 18, who stood in the half circle of people outside the church, the Holy Dormition Cathedral, said she wasn’t normally a churchgoer but she respected holy days.

“I just moved to Kyiv and wanted to visit the famous church,” she said, having arrived from the city of Dnipro in central Ukraine for medical studies.
