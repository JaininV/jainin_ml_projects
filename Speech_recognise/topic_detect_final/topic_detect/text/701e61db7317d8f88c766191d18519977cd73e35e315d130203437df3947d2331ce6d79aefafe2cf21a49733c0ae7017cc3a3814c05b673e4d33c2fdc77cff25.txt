ELIZABETHTOWN — Debo Lewis pitched a no-hitter and the East Bladen junior varsity team scored 10 runs in each of the first two innings Tuesday in a 20-0 win against Fairmont in a Southeastern Athletic Conference baseball game at Russell Priest Field.

Lewis struck out eight and walked two in four innings as East Bladen improved to 5-2 in league play and 8-2 overall. The teams are scheduled to play Thursday at Fairmont.

The closest Fairmont came to getting a base hit came in the fourth inning. Porter Driggers was hit by a pitch. Jordan Collins lofted a ball into short center field, but Cole Butler fielded the fly on a bounce and forced Driggers at second base. Although it would have been scored as a hit without a runner on first base, scoring rules state the play is a fielder’s choice since the runner was forced at second base.

Offensively, East Bladen collected seven hits, used 10 walks, four hit batters and eight Fairmont errors to coast to victory.

Braylon Cromartie went 2-for-2 with 3 runs scored and two runs driven in. Cole Butler had a three-run double and also scored three times. Isaiah Lee had a single, drove in three runs and scored twice. Aiden Hargrove and Easton Boston each had a hit and two RBIs. Andrew Musselwhite had a single, a run driven in and two scored.

The Eagles sent 15 batters to the plate in the first inning and scored 10 runs on only three hits. East Bladen sent 16 batters to the plate in the second inning.
