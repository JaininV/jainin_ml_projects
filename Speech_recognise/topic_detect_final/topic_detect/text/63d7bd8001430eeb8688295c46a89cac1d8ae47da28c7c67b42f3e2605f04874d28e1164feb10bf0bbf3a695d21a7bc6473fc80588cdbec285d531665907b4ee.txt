NF opened higher well above previous IBH of 17715 confirming a multi-day FA (Failed Auction) at 17653 making a strong open as it went on to scale above the weekly VPOC of 17760 & that week’s VWAP of 17802 while hitting 17809 in the IB (Initial Balance)

BNF opened with a 327 point gap up & took support just above yVWAP of 41063 in the opening minutes forcing the shorts who were adding in the last 2 sessions to cover as it left a long initiative buying tail from 41290 to 41075 and almost tagged the 06th Apr Swing High of 41425 in the IB.

The auction then made multiple REs to the upside but they were all marginal ones and could only manage to record a high of 41517 in the K period confirming that the upmove was solely based on short covering and no big demand was coming in at the new highs for this series as even the dPOC shifted higher to 41490 into the close leaving a ‘p’ shape Normal Day with completely higher Value but will need fresh demand above 41490 to continue higher in the coming sessions.
