Balenciaga certainly knows how take a dig at everyday objects. Case in point, its newest bag that takes inspiration from shopping totes you get at duty-free shops. To simulate the see-through effect that ensures your duty-free purchases (fragrances, alcohol and the like) remain visible, Balenciaga does their own Duty Free Tote Bag in full mesh.

Shoppers can look forward to deciding which of the three different sizes to get. Whichever you choose, the lightweight carryalls feature the contrasting BALENCIAGA PARIS emblazoned across the middle.

As for colour choices, the Duty Free Tote Bag will come in Black, Neon Pink and White. While specific shades vary depending on size, aged silver brass hardware accompany all the available variations. These easy-to-use totes also come with a detachable flat zip pouch.

Balenciaga Singapore’s online store is currently not carrying the medium size, so it’s either the small (22 cm by 18 cm) or large (47 cm by 33 cm), for now. Priced at SGD2450 and SGD3250 respectively, these cheeky tote bags are pure whimsy and a whole lot of fun.
