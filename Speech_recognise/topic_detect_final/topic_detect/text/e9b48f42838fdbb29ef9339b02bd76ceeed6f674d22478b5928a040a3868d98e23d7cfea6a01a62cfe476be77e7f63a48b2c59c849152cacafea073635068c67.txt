The Duchess of Edinburgh has embraced sharper, more tailored fashion choices recently, much like the Princess of Wales – and her latest look was no different.

Sophie looked elegant as ever during her visit to HMS Daring at the King's Naval Base in Portsmouth on Tuesday, wearing a well-cut blazer from ME+EM – a favourite brand of both Kate and her sister-in-law the Duchess of Sussex.

She teamed her look with a pretty cream blouse and her favourite Lucia Odescalchi earrings, with her blonde hair pulled back into a low ponytail to show them off.

Sophie's new blazer is the 'Italian Wool Military Button Blazer' from the mid-luxury British brand, which costs £325 and is still available to buy in all sizes, despite its royal recommendation.

Sophie has been HMS Daring's sponsor since 2006, having helped to launch the ship on the Clyde in Glasgow, and has paid the vessel regular visits since then.

Her visit came after her stylish outing on Easter Sunday with the rest of the royal family when she chose a statement hat to attend church, teamed with a bold berry pink coat and suede boots.

The Duchess has sported a number of chic outfits lately, perhaps reflecting her new royal role.

Earlier in April, she looked beautiful in an Altuzarra double-breasted white blazer and a chic burgundy midi skirt as she stepped out to open The Headley Court Veterans' Orthopaedic Centre at The Robert Jones and Agnes Hunt Hospital in Shropshire. She finished the look with chic Prada heels.

Reports have suggested that Sophie enlisted the help of friends Pandora Delevingne and Georgie Pincus to help her with her wardrobe in recent years, and her fashion choices have certainly been impressing royal fans recently.

"She has looked amazing lately!" wrote one on Instagram of her latest look. Another added: "Sophie looks fabulous!"
