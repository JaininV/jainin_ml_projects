Dad is looking for another fight.

At Creator Clash 2, Dad (Nathan Barnatt) was victorious over AB Starkilla, moving his record to 2-0 with two knockouts.

After his victory, Dad grabbed the mic and called out all of WWE, saying WWE previously sent him a contract, which he signed and still has. He said both Triple H and Vince McMahon know him and that everyone, including half the roster, has been dancing around him for years.

He ended by calling out Seth Rollins, saying he should stop fighting phoney YouTube boxing con artists and fight a man who wins. He ended his promo by saying he would be waiting for Rollins.

Dad has appeared on AEW programming before alongside John Morrison and has trained in wrestling.

He trained alongside Morrison, who also fought at Creator Clash 2. Morrison scored a third round knockout over Harley Morenstein of Epic Meal Time.
