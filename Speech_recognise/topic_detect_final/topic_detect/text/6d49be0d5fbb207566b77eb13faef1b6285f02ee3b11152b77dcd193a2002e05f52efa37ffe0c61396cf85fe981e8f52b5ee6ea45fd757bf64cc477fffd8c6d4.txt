UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. — Many experts agree that the subject of freedom of speech can be a confusing and complicated topic. Both society and campus communities have been challenged over this fundamental right, particularly in the past few years.

To expand the Penn State community’s understanding of the First Amendment, University leaders have proactively engaged students, faculty and staff in free speech conversations this semester and last. In addition, in support of Penn State’s mission to educate, a primer on the First Amendment has been created. The document not only addresses the University’s stance on free speech, but also provides further information on how Penn State protects this right and responds to key questions from the community.

Additional University resources include Addressing Bias: Rights, Responsibilities and Responses. This website was created in partnership with students and is available to faculty, staff and students that want to know more about how they can use their voices and engage in critical dialogue on difficult topics such as freedom of speech.
