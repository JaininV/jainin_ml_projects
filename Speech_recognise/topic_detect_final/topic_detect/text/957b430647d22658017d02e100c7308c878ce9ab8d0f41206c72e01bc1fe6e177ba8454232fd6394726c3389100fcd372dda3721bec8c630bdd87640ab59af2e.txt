Managers suffer from the superimposition of the most powerful lens of the day on their day to day work.

In the 60'sâ€“70's the manager metaphor was war/generals.

Right now trauma/therapist is that lens.

We expect managers to be like therapists and manage the whole employee.

Creating safe spaces and listening non-judgementally are two must have manager skills are things actual therapists train years not to suck at [in addition to going through deep analysis themselves].

And most still struggle with those skills.

Too easily and too fast we superimpose a new outside lens on managers without understanding first and second order impact, proper training and support.

Until the next lens comes along.

Of course work is a reflection of society.

So change is bound to happen in how we work.

But more thought and scrutiny at CEO and CHRO level is needed of how to let societal narrative changes impact the workplace culture companies are trying to build.

Otherwise the only thing being built is a long term workplace culture of anxiety.
