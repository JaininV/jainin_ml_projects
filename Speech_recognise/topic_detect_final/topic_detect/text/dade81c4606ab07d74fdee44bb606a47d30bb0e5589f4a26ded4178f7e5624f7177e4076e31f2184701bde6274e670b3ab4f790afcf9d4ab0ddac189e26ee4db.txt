With Joventut just three games away from a potential EuroLeague return, its former All-EuroLeague center can make his return to Europe’s premier competition

Ante Tomic could have chosen to sign with a club in the Turkish Airlines EuroLeague last summer, but ultimately he decided to return to Joventut Badalona, which has been his home since 2020. He signed a two-year extension and, thanks to his and his team’s outstanding play, he may have the chance to get back to the EuroLeague with Joventut.

While the Spanish club had some ups and down and proved to be unlucky after the latest injury of Pau Ribas, they started the season as the favorites to make it to the top and at this point, they have as strong a chance as anyone of capturing the 7DAYS EuroCup trophy and with it a spot in the EuroLeague for the 2023-24 season.

That may end up being the last season of Tomic as a player, who is already 36 years old, but still a main contributor to his club.

After all, big men usually last more at the top level compared to guards and Tomic is living proof. To be exact with an average PIR of 17.2 this season, he is 14th on the list, however, he’s played fewer minutes than anyone above him in this ranking, just 22:45 per game.

If you calculate his numbers on a per-minute basis, he is the second-most effective player in the competition, behind Hapoel Vegan-Friendly Tel Aviv’s Jaylen Hoard.

Not bad for a player who started playing professionally in 2004 and moved to EuroLeague in 2010 with Real Madrid. Tomic remained at the top level for more than a decade, highlighted by eight seasons with FC Barcelona.

His current contract with Joventut expires in the summer of 2025 when Tomic will be 38 years old, so there’s still gas left in the tank.

After all, that was evident one week ago in the EuroCup Eighthfinals, when he was the top player for the Spanish side in an 89-78 win over the London Lions. Tomic finished the game with a PIR of 24, finishing the night with 16 points and 9 rebounds.

Unlike most of the other teams in the EuroCup Quarterfinals, Joventut is no stranger to the EuroLeague. It was there during the Ricky (Rubio) and Rudy (Fernandez) era and has a long tradition in the competition as well as a fan base that knows the sport and loves the team.

“The crowd always helps us and when the Olimpic is like this, it’s much easier to play”, said Tomic after the win over the Lions and the same crowd will be there for the upcoming game against Hapoel.

And while traditionally Joventut bets on its young talent to achieve big things, this time around it’s a respected veteran who leads the charge.

Tomic is ranked fifth on the EuroLeague’s all-time rebounding charts and is 19th all-time in scoring, despite his absence from the competition since 2020. He was named to the first All-EuroLeague First Team in both 2012-13 and 2013-14 and the Second Team in 2014-15.

Can he make his big return with a third different team? We are potentially three games away from finding out.
