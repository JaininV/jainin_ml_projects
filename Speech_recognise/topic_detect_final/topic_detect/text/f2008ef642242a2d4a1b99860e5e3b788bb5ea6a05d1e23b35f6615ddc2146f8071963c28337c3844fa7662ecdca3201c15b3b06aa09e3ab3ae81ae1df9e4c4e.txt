It wasn’t good enough – Don Jazzy reveals why he didn’t release song with Wizkid

Veteran Nigerian producer and singer, Don Jazzy has revealed why he hasn’t released any song with Grammy award-winning singer, Wizkid.

The Mavin boss said he recorded two songs with the ‘Ojuelegba’ crooner, but none came out of the studio.

Don Jazzy disclosed this in a Q&A session on his Instagram page recently.

A fan asked him when he would have a song with Wizkid, and he said they had two songs together, but they weren’t good enough.

He said, “I think we actually did like two songs a while back but we never released it. I think it wasn’t good enough. Sometimes, we have those days when you do some songs and you people are not feeling it like that.”

Don Jazzy, however, pointed out that he and Wizkid already worked together on Dr Sid’s ‘Surulere’ Remix years back.

He said they may drop more collaborative songs in the future.
