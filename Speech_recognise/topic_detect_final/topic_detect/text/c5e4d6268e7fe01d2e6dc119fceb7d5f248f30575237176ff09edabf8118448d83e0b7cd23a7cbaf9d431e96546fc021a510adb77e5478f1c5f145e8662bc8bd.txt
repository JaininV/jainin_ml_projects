Loose Women's Stacey Solomon has confirmed she is set to return to work, two months after giving birth to Belle.

Taking to Instagram on Tuesday (April 18), the I’m A Celeb star shared a series of stories about her return to work.

“I've got my first day back next week and it's like the craziest job ever," Solomon said. “I’m going to Paris, what the hell.”

Solomon went on to tell fans that she “never gets jobs like this”.

"​​I get the 'come and tidy my house' jobs, which I love by the way. I'm not mocking it [but] I don't get the 'come to Paris’ jobs," the Sort Your Life Out host added.

Solomon revealed that she is set to take Belle, who was born February 7, to Paris with her. “I haven’t worked out the breastfeeding thing yet. I’m trying to wean her off which is sad, but I just can’t do it all. I can't do work, school runs, kids, breastfeeding. It's just impossible," she continued.

“Breastfeeding is hard. I’m going to have to stop, but I haven’t managed to do it yet.”

Elsewhere in the update to fans, Solomon teased her new Channel 4 DIY show Brickin’ It!, and confirmed season four of BBC’s Sort Your Life Out is also due to start filming soon. “It’s going to be manic for the next few months,” she said.

Shortly after the birth of Belle, Solomon hit back at trolls who tried to shame her for having her nails done.

Reposting a comment that claimed they were impractical for a new mum, the star said: "Well, I think they’re really practical. Will I end up with poo under them at the end of every day? Probably, but I've got a nail brush, I wash my hands, it'll be fine."

Sort Your Life Out season 2 premiered on January 24 on BBC One and is available to watch on iPlayer. Loose Women airs on weekdays at 12.30pm on ITV1 and streams on ITVX.
