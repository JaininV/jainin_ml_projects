An 88-year-old man shot a 19-year-old family member before turning the gun on himself Monday morning at a Kaufman apartment complex, authorities say.

Officers responded to the Bridgewood Ranch Apartments in the 4100 block of Vista Lane after witnesses reported multiple gunshots, police said.

A 19-year-old man was found near the complex’s swimming pool with a gunshot wound to his abdomen, according to police, and told officers the relative who shot him was still in the apartment.

When officers and the SWAT team got into the apartment, they found an 88-year-old man dead from an apparently self-inflicted gunshot wound, police said.

The 19-year-old was taken to a Dallas hospital and was stable, police said.

Neither person’s name has been released

No additional information was immediately available, and the investigation is ongoing.
