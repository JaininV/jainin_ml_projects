A decorated chalice to use however you like. Mother's Day gift idea.

You can put small plants, candies or small objects in it.

Print-in-place and doesnâ€™t need supports to be printed.

If you have adhesion difficulties while printing, I recommend using raft or brim. Good calibration and retraction is necessary for a great result. If you print it, I would love to see it and get your feedback, it is important to me; and if you have any doubts or problems on any printing steps, please write me.
