As promised last week, the Fallout 76 April 2023 update is here, and it does fix a ton of bugs that are currently present in the game. Some of these are longstanding issues, and some (as we’ve talked about many times in the past) involve short-term problems that were actually patched in: occasionally in patches that are meant to fix bugs. Ah, classic Bethesda.

In any case, Fallout 76 is a much better game than it was at launch, thanks to all of the major content patches that added in, well, Fallout things. It also reworks some mod descriptions, to help them be “more consistent and clearer.” This is a common complaint in many live service games, where hardcore players will need to datamine or otherwise tease out actual stats/procs (when an item triggers an ability) manually: when patch notes or in-game text isn’t descriptive enough.

This April patch is small time because the team is planning another summer update themed around cryptids, including quests dealing with The Blue Devil and the Ogua.
