The youth of the Church will have a worldwide testimony meeting on Sunday, October 22, 2023, at 7:00 p.m. local times.

A short, prerecorded message focusing on Jesus Christ will be shown at the beginning of a locally planned and hosted testimony meeting for youth. After the message, youth will share their testimonies with one another.

Youth can connect globally following the testimony meeting by sharing their experiences in person and online using the hashtag #AllThingsThroughChrist.
