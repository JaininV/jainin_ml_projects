Leafs coach Sheldon Keefe didn’t come right out and say it, but Knies is unlikely to be in the lineup for Game 1 against the Tampa Bay Lightning on Tuesday.  “Every experience he gets is going to help him and with the talent that he has shown, he’s a guy that can help us and it’s another great option for us to have,” Keefe said. “He hasn’t even seen the ice at Scotiabank Arena, let alone skated on it. All of these things are new to him.”

Knies, who moved into Tavares’ basement after the Leafs captain extended that invite, said he will be ready when called upon.  “I’ll be anywhere they need me, honestly,” Knies said. “I’m here to help the team. I’m here to try to contribute as much as I can and wherever I can.”  Off the ice, Knies was thrilled that Tavares approached him about becoming a housemate at his Toronto-area abode. Other Leafs veterans had a similar idea for Knies, but it was Tavares who had the initial offer.   “I didn’t really want to be stuck in a hotel in my own little bubble, so I’m happy that he opened up and welcomed me and I’ve enjoyed it,” Knies said. “It has definitely made me feel a lot more comfortable in Toronto.  “I’m super-fortunate that he did that. It’s awesome. It makes me feel way more part of the (Leafs) family.”
