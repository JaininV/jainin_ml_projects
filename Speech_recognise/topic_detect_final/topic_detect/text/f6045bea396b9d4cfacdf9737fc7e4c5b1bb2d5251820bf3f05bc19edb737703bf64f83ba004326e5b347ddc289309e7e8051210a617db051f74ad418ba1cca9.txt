Russia's defense ministry on Sunday said that Wagner mercenary units captured two more city blocks in the northwest and southeastern parts of Ukraine's Bakhmut.

Britain said in an intelligence update on Friday that Ukrainian troops had been forced to withdraw from some territory in the city in the face of a renewed Russian assault.
