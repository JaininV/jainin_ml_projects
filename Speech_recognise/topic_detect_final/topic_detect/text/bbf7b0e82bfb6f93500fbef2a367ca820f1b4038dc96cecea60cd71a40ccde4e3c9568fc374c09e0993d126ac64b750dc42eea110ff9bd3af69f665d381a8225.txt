“If I was missing, would my face be on the news, in the papers? Probably not,” she told an audience who gathered with her and Fast Horse for a screening of her video documentary at the YES! House in Granite Falls on March 15.

Kafka said that observation led her to become passionate about the need to raise awareness about Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women. She sought out someone whose story could be told.

She learned in an article in The Guardian about the ordeal experienced by Fast Horse and got in contact. Since producing the documentary, Kafka and Fast Horse have joined to offer screenings to other communities, such as Madison.

Kafka produced the documentary with a budget of zero. She was the entire production crew. . . .

Fast Horse's fears were eased when one of her daughters, who has a degree in information technology, was able to get into the missing daughter’s Facebook account and track her whereabouts. She now knew her daughter was alive, Fast Horse said.

After roughly 18 weeks, Fast Horse said her daughter returned with a knock on the door. She came home thin, with dark circles under her eyes, and not wearing the clothes she had been wearing when she disappeared, according to Fast Horse.

A person she thought was a friend had given her a ride the day she disappeared, Fast Horse said her daughter eventually told her. She had been taken away and often kept locked in a closet, fed a diet of mostly peanut butter despite her allergy to peanuts, and was beaten, said Fast Horse.

To this day, her daughter will tell her very little about what happened.

One thing was clear: The persistent campaign by Fast Horse to find her missing daughter mattered.
