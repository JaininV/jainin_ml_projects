Charlie didn’t think Nick could ever like him back, but now they’re officially boyfriends. Nick has even found the courage to come out to his mom. But coming out isn’t something that happens just once, and Nick and Charlie try to figure out when to tell their friends that they’re dating. Not being out to their classmates gets even harder during a school trip to Paris. As Nick and Charlie’s feelings get more serious, they’ll need each other more than ever.

Back to the world of Nick and Charlie and it’s so good.

I love this series because the characters are so realistic. They’re funny, heartbreaking and real. I’m wrapped up in this couple. Really. I couldn’t put this volume down and was sad to see it end. The writing is much like that of the age group the boys are and it’s shown in the same manner that young people in their situation struggle. It’s realistic and that’s great.

I’ve read the others in this series and I’m glad I did. It helped me to understand what the characters are going through and how hard it is to be a teen. Nick is just starting to come to terms with who he is and coming out to his family. It’s hard and the book shows that. Charlie, while already out, is dealing with an eating disorder, brought on by teasing because he’s gay. A lot of young people can identify with the characters.

This is written in a tender, but real way. The characters struggle, but it’s like reading the picture diary of friends. I loved it.

If you’re looking for a book with tender but teen characters and a great storyline, then this might be the book for you.
