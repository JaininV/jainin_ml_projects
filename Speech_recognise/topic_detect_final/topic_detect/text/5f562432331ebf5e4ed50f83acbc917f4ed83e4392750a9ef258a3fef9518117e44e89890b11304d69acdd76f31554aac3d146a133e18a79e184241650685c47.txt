“Today is Vaisakhi, one of the most important days on the Sikh calendar. We extend our warmest wishes to everyone who celebrates as they mark the day with prayers, festivals and selfless acts of service to those less fortunate, also known as seva.

“Vaisakhi commemorates the creation of the Khalsa – the community of baptized Sikhs – in 1699 by Guru Gobind Singh Ji, the 10th Guru of Sikhs. It also marks the start of the traditional spring harvest season. For Hindus and Sikhs, today is the beginning of the Indian Solar New Year.

“To everyone celebrating Vaisakhi, we wish you all the best.
