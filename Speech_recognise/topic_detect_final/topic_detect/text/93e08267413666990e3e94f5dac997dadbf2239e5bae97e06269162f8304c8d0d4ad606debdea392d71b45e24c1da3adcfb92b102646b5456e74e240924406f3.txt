I’m starting to realize how easy the day-to-day work of domain investors can be. It’s a pretty simple business. If you’re brokering names, it’s one thing. Or if you have 15,000 names. But if you have a few thousand and just park and wait, it’s easy. I’m not saying it’s easy money, but it takes at most an hour or two a day to manage your names and answer emails. If we ever had a better registrar and marketplace, we could cut this time in half.

Since I retired, I’ve actually made more money than before because I make sure my landers are optimized, put some BIN prices, and spend a little more time looking for good names. I didn’t have much time after making this list, but now I do. I don’t spend much time in forums but talk to people more over the phone and in Zoom meetings. People are the key, and some incredible information comes from great meetings. I love domain investors, but it can be a bit of a vacuum, so I try to branch out.

I’m not going to stay retired forever, I have too much I want to do and you’ll find out why I retired soon enough 😀
