If you've been thinking about upgrading your TV and your current smartphone is also on its last legs then Samsung might have just what you are looking for. The Korean technology giant has just announced the launch of an incredible new deal that's offering customers the chance to grab its latest and greatest flagship Galaxy S23 phone for just £100 when splashing out on a new telly.

Considering the S23 usually costs £899 - that's an unbeatable discount that you clearly won't find anywhere else. Samsung says that getting the deal is easy. All you have to do is pop the new telly and a 128GB Galaxy S23 in your online shopping basket and the discount will then be applied automatically.

The only slight elephant in the room is that this deal is only available on Samsung's more premium Neo QLED 8K range of screens which aren't exactly cheap.

For example, the QN700C range starts from £2,899 whilst the flagship QN900C tops out at £9,599 if you opt for the ultimate 85-inch screen.

To help soften the financial blow, Samsung is also offering up to £700 cashback if you hand over your old TV and you can opt to pay things back in instalments with some TVs available for as little as £80 per month via Samsung's zero percent finance plan.
