The March 14 edition of AEW Rampage drew a 0.21 rating and 639,000 viewers courtesy of the NBA Playoffs lead-in. The figures were the highest in almost a year.

On the latest edition of Wrestling Observer Radio, Dave Meltzer reported that the opening minutes of last Friday’s episode of Rampage, featuring Aussie Open vs. The Best Friends, garnered 1.466 viewers, with about 713,000 viewers in the key P18-49 key demo.

The figures are likely the highest for an AEW segment since CM Punk’s AEW debut.

In response to the news of the high Rampage viewership, Mark Davis of Aussie Open tweeted the following to Tony Khan, “hey tk I got your fat Wembley headliner right here brother.”
