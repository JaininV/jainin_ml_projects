“We saw a substantial rise in rates to the tune of about 4% over an 18-month period,” said Mike Coop, UK chief investment officer at Morningstar Investment Management.  “It takes time before those interest rate increases flow through to the real economy as people pay higher rates on their mortgages and companies pay higher rates when they refinance their debt.”  The FTSE 100 clocked its longest winning streak since December 2020 on Tuesday, buoyed by defensive and commodity-linked stocks. However, signs of sticky inflation in a stagnating economy have dented investor sentiment.  Industrial miners lost 1.0%, led by a 2.3% fall in Antofagasta after the Chilean miner’s copper output fell in the March quarter from the previous three months due to lower water availability and reduced ore grades.  Food, beverages and tobacco sector was a bright spot, up 0.8% on the heels of sticky inflation numbers.  “No signs yet of the cost of living crisis easing means consumer staples will perform more strongly as they are the items of expenditure that are always needed,” said Stuart Cole, chief macro economist at Equiti Capital.  Leading losses on the FTSE 250 was    Asset Management Plc, down 5.5% as the asset manager reported significant quarterly net outflows.
