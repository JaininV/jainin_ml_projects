The solid shoulders and the muscular legs might give me away.  And my bust is poorly developed, I admit.  But I think that my face has lost that ugly aggression that was once my hallmark.  And I like to wear my hair up in a bun like this, even when I am not dancing.  I think that it is truly feminine, and now that is what I really want to be.

My mother told me that I needed to find a physical outlet for all my energy, and something that did not lead me into violence.  Before I knew it I was dispatched to my Aunt Beth's dance camp.  As Aunt Beth explained, it was for female dancers only, so that was what I had to be.

The big surprise was that I loved it.  It was energetic but also artistic, and I was surprised to find within myself the desire to create beautiful things - beautiful movements and an attractive presentation.  I had found a pursuit in life that saw me leave everything else behind me.  I had found poise.
