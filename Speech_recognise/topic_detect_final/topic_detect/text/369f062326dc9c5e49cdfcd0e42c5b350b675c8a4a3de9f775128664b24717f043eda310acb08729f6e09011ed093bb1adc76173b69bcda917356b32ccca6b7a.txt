KEZAD Group and Emtelle have begun constructing a large facility in Abu Dhabi for manufacturing, distributing, and researching blown fibre units and ducted network solutions.

The project is set to become one of the largest manufacturing plants worldwide

The new facility is being developed in three phases. The first phase of the development was recently initiated with the ground-breaking ceremony.

Emtelle plans to invest around $50 million in the facility over the course of the three phases.

The new facility will include distribution and R&D innovation centres, and is part of Emtelle’s strategy to expand its presence in the Middle East and APAC markets.

“Today is a historic landmark for KEZAD and Emtelle as we begin the development of Emtelle’s new home in Abu Dhabi,” said Mohamed Al Khadar Al Ahmed, CEO Khalifa Economic Zones, Abu Dhabi – KEZAD Group.

“Our motto in KEZAD is that we are here to listen, support and deliver. The development of this facility under our Build-to-Suit service provides our clients with a customised solution to develop in line with their requirements and budget and according to their specifications.”

In December 2022, the President of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) inaugurated AD Ports Group’s Khalifa Port expansion, a major development project with a total investment of AED4 billion ($1 billion).
