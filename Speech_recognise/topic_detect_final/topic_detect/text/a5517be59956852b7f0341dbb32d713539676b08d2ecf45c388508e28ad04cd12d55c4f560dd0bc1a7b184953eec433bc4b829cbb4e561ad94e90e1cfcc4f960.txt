Minnesota Timberwolves center Rudy Gobert, who has been dealing with back spasms, told reporters that the two days of rest he's received between Games 1 and 2 of his team's Western Conference first-round playoff series against the Denver Nuggets has been "huge" for his healing.

Gobert posted eight points and 13 rebounds in 26 minutes during his team's 109-80 loss to Denver on Sunday.

Gobert has been dealing with the back spasms for a few weeks. He told reporters he gutted through the injury during his team's 113-108 home win over the New Orleans Pelicans to close the regular season on Sunday, April 9. Gobert's day ended early after he threw a punch at teammate Kyle Anderson during a sideline scuffle.

Minnesota suspended Gobert for the Wolves' play-in game against the Los Angeles Lakers on Tuesday, but the big man said he wouldn't have been able to play regardless due to the injury.

Gobert returned for Minnesota's 120-95 play-in win over the Oklahoma City Thunder on Friday, dropping 21 points and 10 rebounds in 33 minutes.

This past Sunday was a rough effort for Gobert and the rest of the Wolves, who were thoroughly outclassed all game en route to the 29-point loss. However, a healthier Gobert should certainly help Minnesota as it looks to get back into this series.

Minnesota will face Denver for Game 2 at 10 p.m. ET in Ball Arena on Wednesday.
