Shout out to the driver, Tyler, from Cocco’s Pizzeria in Aston! This is how you serve a pizza and justice at the same time:

Every super hero needs a catch phrase and I wouldn’t expect anything less than, “You fucking idiot” being the one chosen from a Delco guy.

I still have a lot of questions I want answered. Why didn’t he just give her the pizza? Has this woman been hoping for a high speed chase her entire life? Is Jaeger her kid or husband’s name? Did our hero choose #11 for his adult softball league because of Carson Wentz? I hope one day we’re able to get an answer to all of these.

In the meantime, we need to get Tyler delivering pizzas in Philly. Call him up to the big leagues. You think Batman wanted to stay fighting crime in Hoboken? He knew he needed to prove his worth in Gotham. Stopping carjacking minors in Brookhaven is one thing. Stopping carjacking minors in Philly is the final boss.
