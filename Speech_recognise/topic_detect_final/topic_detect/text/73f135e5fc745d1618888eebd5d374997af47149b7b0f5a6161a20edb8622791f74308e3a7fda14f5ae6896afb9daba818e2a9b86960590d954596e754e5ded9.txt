MIDLAND Last week, Midland College (MC) opened summer and fall registration. Advisors recommend that students interested in attending MC register early in order to ensure they get the classes and class times that they want.

Registration Day events will take place in the Scharbauer Student Center on the main Midland College campus. For more information, contact the Midland College Admissions & Outreach department at [email protected], (432) 685-4501.

Throughout the next four months, MC will be hosting a series of “Registration Days” at convenient times for people to take advantage of assistance in completing the MC application, find out about financial aid and scholarship opportunities and visit with advisors. Students will also be able to take a campus tour and speak with representatives from Student Life. All who participate in these special days are eligible for a $500 MC scholarship drawing once they enroll in fall courses. The first Registration Day is this Saturday, April 15, starting at 9:00 am.

Other Registration Days and times are as follows:

“We welcome all to our special Registration Days — those who are graduating from high school, as well as people who are interested in pursuing additional credentials for job retraining or skills attainment,” Katelyn Workman, dean of Admissions, Outreach & Financial Aid, said. “Our staff is always available to assist with admissions and enrollment during regular college business hours. Those who apply and enroll in fall courses by July 1 will receive priority consideration for scholarships.”
