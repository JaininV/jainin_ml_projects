Dallas-raised R&B and neo-soul singer Erykah Badu has a key to Deep Ellum and a cannabis brand. Now, she’s ready to tour.

Badu announced her 25-stop “Unfollow Me” tour on Monday. The tour kicks off June 11 in San Antonio and concludes July 23 at the American Airlines Center in Dallas.

It features support from hip-hop artist Yasiin Bey (formerly Mos Def).

Badu has played various theater and festival dates in recent years. Last summer, her “The Digging Crystals in Badubotron Tour” played seven dates, including Dallas twice.

In February, she threw her annual birthday bash at The Factory where the Deep Ellum Foundation bestowed her with its first-ever key to Deep Ellum. The same night, she revealed that she would be releasing a new strain of recreational cannabis.

She has continued to produce work in her hometown. Her debut album, Baduizm, which recently turned 26, was recorded in part at Dallas Sound Lab and won a Grammy Award for Best R&B Album. She has since released four more studio albums that all have reached the Billboard charts.

Tickets will go on sale on April 20 at 2:22 p.m. on Ticketmaster. Exclusive presale access is available by signing up for the AT&T Center’s All Access Newsletter and selecting the “Rap and Hip Hop” genre.
