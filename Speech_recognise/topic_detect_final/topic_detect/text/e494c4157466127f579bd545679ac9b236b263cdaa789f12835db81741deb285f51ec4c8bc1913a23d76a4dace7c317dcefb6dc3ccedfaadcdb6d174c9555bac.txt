Psychotherapy's dirty little secret is that we have no evidence it actually works.

Hundreds of studies, thousands of practitioners, and millions of patients hours later, we still need to prove if talk therapy is anything but an expensive waste of time.

I know that's a shocker, but it's high time we faced some hard truths about this empirically unverified field. My years as a psychology student and practicing therapist have taught me one thing: we're all just improvising.

What do we call alternative medicine that's been proven not to work?

We wrap our feeble speculations in jargon and misleading metaphors and charge an arm and a leg for the privilege. Don't get me wrong, I've seen the benefits of therapy.

But so do placebos.

People feel better because they expect to feel better, not because of any magic inherent to our methods. Patients and profits are the only real products of our industry. They tell you the therapy is scientific.

We do neither.

We “validate” each other's hunches and call it research. Insiders know most breakthroughs come from outsiders, but we guard our turf fiercely against competent opposition.

Our whole field would collapse if we abandoned our myths. The truth that drives the shadow of a nail into psychiatry's coffin: we have no idea if anything we do helps.

It's make-believe backed by smoke, mirrors, and cash.

I wish this weren't so, believe me.

I wanted to help people as sincerely as any other clinician. But we muster more passion than rigor, leaving patients as lab rats in a sham experiment. For their sake, and our own integrity, we must face facts: psychotherapy may always remain an evidence-free zone.

The bags under patients' eyes, not any proven merit, keep the money flowing.

The only rational conclusion: pull back the curtain and look at the money-grubbing charlatans behind it.

We are not healers or scientists.

We are fraudsters with fancy degrees and expensive licenses to print money. Harsh words?

But it's high time we heard them. The only real madness is a field that insists it helps when it so clearly does not. Every dollar spent on ineffective “treatment” is a tragedy.

The truth will not remain buried forever. The day we reckon with it will be too late. Speak uncomfortable truths and this is the thanks you get.

So be it.

Somebody has to say psychotherapy stinks to high heaven. It might as well be me. I’m through worshiping at the altar of evidence-free practice. Over to you, whether you listen or forever turn a blind eye.

This is not about pessimism but honesty.

Time to wipe the blind faith from our eyes and reexamine all. Under the lights, our discipline has depth as a puddle.
