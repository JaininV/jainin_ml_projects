So what exactly is a book hangover? There are probably slightly different iterations: I always see people talking about novels, but here I am with a nonfiction book. The gist, though, is that it’s a “condition in which attachment to a book or series that has ended causes the reader traumatic emotional distress.” While reading that sentence, my brain went “No, thank you!” because why would I want to feel “traumatic emotional distress”? Have you read the news? Looked outside? And yet, as I finished listening to How Far the Light Reaches, I could not shake off Imbler’s words, thoughts, and beautifully constructed book. In a good way. I wasn’t worried about my next read, or how it would compare — maybe we would be better off not comparing books at all, but let’s save that fight for another day. Instead, I was in awe of how this book had burrowed inside of me, ready to be carried forever. And I wanted more. More of that feeling. I wanted to feel so deeply again while reading after years of only seeking cozy things because the world had become increasingly harder and scarier. The world has continued on that awful path — keep fighting back against our rights being taken away! — but I suddenly felt myself attached once again to big emotions, deep thoughts, and complicated feelings thanks to Imbler. And I wanted to sit with those feelings, rather than rush off to something new.
