The Yucca Valley High School Trojan Golf squad is coming out of spring break and striving to take home another league title. The team is currently 6-0

Head Coach Jason Harvey believes they are in full control of their season, saying “We had some of our tough road matches early in the season. We began the season with 8 players who have never played in a competitive golf match before, so we tempered our expectations on some of the early road matches.”

Trojan Golf resumes play with Coachella Valley and 29 Palms at home. Freshman Jacob Warden and Ben Carlton have lead the scoring in the early matches, with 5 out of 6 medalist awards (Low Score of the Match) going to one of the two golfers. Jacob Warden credited his success to his focus on consistency.

Trojan Golf will finish out the regular season in the last 2 weeks of April, and then look to prepare for CIF play.
