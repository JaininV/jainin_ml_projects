Inspector General of Police Chowdhury Abdullah Al-Mamun has reminded the capital's residents to be extra cautious with their belongings before leaving for their home districts for the Eid-ul-Fitr vacation.

Speaking at a press conference at the Sayedabad bus terminal around 1:00pm today, the IGP requested residents to either take their cash, jewellery and other valuables with them or leave those with relatives before departing Dhaka.

He said there is a possibility that many areas of the capital will be vulnerable to theft if a large number of the city population left for Eid.

The IGP also advised outbound passengers not to consume food given to them by strangers or co-passengers.

Responding to questions about the recent incidents of fires in markets, Al-Mamun said, "We are closely investigating the incidents of fire. It is being investigated whether there is any sabotage involved. If someone is found involved, strict action would be taken against them."

He also said discussions are ongoing with market committees in Dhaka and other districts to coordinate efforts and ensure people safety.
