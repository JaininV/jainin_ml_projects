The UK Civil Aviation Authority has published new airspace policy for integrating beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) remotely piloted aerial systems (RPAS) into airspace, CAP 2533. The roadmap includes consideration of the way that unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) operating beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) will be integrated within the airspace system. The concept utilises specific types of airspace structures to transition from segregated BVLOS operations, through the managed accommodation of a varied range of airspace operations, toward the ultimate objective of enabling integrated, unsegregated operations for all airspace users in standard ICAO classifications of airspace.

The CAA extends an invite to RPAS operators with experience of BVLOS trial flying to trial the concept through its regulatory sandbox. The trial will see the use of temporary reserved areas (TRA) in conjunction with appropriate procedures and/or technology to accommodate the operation of unmanned aircraft (UA) in unsegregated airspace. The call is open to individual organisations or consortia working on the development of UA systems (UAS) operating beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS).

The objectives of the sandbox are to: • Demonstrate and validate any specific technologies, airspace management procedures, and flight operation procedures that are needed to enable the safe, managed integration of BVLOS UAS and crewed aircraft. • Enable the CAA to validate the use of the airspace policy concept with real world use cases to evidence how it supports and enables the accommodation phase. • Enable participants to progress beyond segregation towards integration of BVLOS UAS flights with crewed aircraft.

The Regulatory Sandbox is managed by the CAA Innovation Advisory Services team working in collaboration with the Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) Unit and Airspace, Air Traffic Management & Aerodromes (AAA) Department.
