TRAFFIC summonses for 2022 and earlier pending settlement in court are not eligible for the Hari Raya discount announced by Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim yesterday, police said today.

Bukit Aman traffic investigation and enforcement department director Mat Kasim Karim also said the offer differs from the Police Day offer of up to 60% off summonses.

He said the Police Day discount earlier did not cover some summonses: crashes, non-compoundable offences, jumping red lights and summonses with warrant status.

“However, the special summons rate announced by the prime minister yesterday is different and is lower than the 60% discount for each summons.

“Members of the public can settle their summonses online via MyBayar Saman application or physically at all traffic counters at state or district headquarters nationwide from April 21 to May 21 2023,” he said today.

Mat Kasim said there is no limit to the number of summonses, welcoming people to settle all fines they have received.

Yesterday, Anwar announced the Special Summons Rate of RM50 for all traffic summonses in 2022 and earlier from April 21 to May 21. – Bernama, April 19, 2023.
