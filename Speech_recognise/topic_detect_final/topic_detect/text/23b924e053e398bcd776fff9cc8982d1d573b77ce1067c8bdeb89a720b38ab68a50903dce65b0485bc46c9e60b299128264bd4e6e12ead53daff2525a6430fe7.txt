Best Upgraded Version of supervillains in DC — The Darkest Knight

The Batman Who Laughs had already gained a reputation as a formidable supervillain and captured the interest of fans prior to the conclusion of Dark Nights: Death Metal. Yet, unsatisfied with his current state, he underwent a mind fusion with another universe’s Doctor Manhattan.

This merger between the two antagonists gave rise to The Darkest Knight, an all-powerful menace to the DC Universe. Possessing unparalleled power, potentially the most significant enhancement in DC history, The Darkest Knight held the capacity to annihilate the multiverse and reshape it according to his twisted desires.

Already a formidable DC Universe villain, may not need an upgrade, but his powers have been amplified in certain narratives. In Justice League Odyssey #24 (by Dan Abnett and Cliff Richards), he obtains control over reality. During a confrontation with the Justice League Odyssey, Darkseid captures the Revision Mechanism and becomes the Lord of Time. This newfound ability allows him to manipulate time itself, which he attempts to wield against the Justice League in order to bring about their demise.

Best Upgraded Version of supervillains in DC — Apex Lex

During DC’s Year of the Villain event, which spanned nearly a full year, Lex Luthor fused with Martian Manhunter’s DNA, creating Apex Lex. This hybrid retained Luthor’s intellect and gained J’onn J’onnz’s powers, becoming nearly invincible. As a harbinger of Perpetua, Apex Lex journeyed through the DC Universe with the mission to sway the multiverse’s balance towards destruction. To wage war against the heroes, he enlisted and enhanced an entire army of supervillains, making them even more formidable adversaries.

In Dark Crisis on Infinite Earths (by Joshua Williamson and Daniel Sampere), Deathstroke was possessed by the Great Darkness, which significantly enhanced his power and influenced his choices. This upgrade provided Deathstroke with a substantial advantage over the surviving DCU heroes, following the apparent demise of the Justice League. As the primary embodiment of the Great Darkness, he engaged heroes in battle. This remarkable transformation, which elevated a formidable mortal into a cosmic avatar, represents one of the most significant power upgrades in the DC Universe.

Best Upgraded Version of supervillains in DC — Black Manta

During DC’s Year of the Villain event, Lex Luthor journeyed across the DC Universe, enhancing the abilities of every villain he encountered. When he met Black Manta, who was attempting to defeat Aquaman, Luthor offered not only an upgrade but also a family reunion for the Hydes.

Black Manta’s father was integrated into a Mecha Black Manta suit as an artificial intelligence, assisting the villain in his battle against Aquaman. Mecha Manta was then reprogrammed by his son to confront the Atlanteans on the surface. Equipped with immense weaponry and Manta’s signature eye lasers, he became a formidable adversary.

Mister Mxyzptlk, an imp from the fifth dimension, decided to test what an inhabitant of the regular realm would do with his abilities and chose The Joker for this experiment. Initially, Mxyzptlk intended to grant only 1% of his power to The Joker, but the insane clown deceived him into divulging his real name, which resulted in The Joker receiving 99.99% of Mxyzptlk’s powers. In just 69 seconds, The Joker transformed the universe into a distorted parody of his own image, leaving everyone trapped in a perpetual cycle.

Best Upgraded Version of supervillains in DC — Brainiac 13

Around the year 2000, Brainiac unveiled his scheme of planting a dormant computer virus into LexCorp’s Y2K bug safeguards to drastically enhance his own abilities. However, this action had an unintended outcome as it enabled his future self, Brainiac 13 from the 64th century, to travel back in time to seize control of Brainiac 2.5’s body. Brainiac 13 then proceeded to transform Metropolis into a futuristic version of the city under his reign.

Despite acquiring control over a few android superheroes like Red Tornado, Hourman, and the Metal Men, and deploying them against Superman, Brainiac 13’s plan was thwarted when Superman discovered that he was unable to handle Kryptonian technology, which presented an opportunity for Superman to put an end to Brainiac’s scheme during his confrontation with the Eradicator.

Issue #2 of Superman centers on the Man of Steel and his family’s endeavors to confront a swarm of Parasites that have infiltrated the streets of Metropolis. A single Parasite has always been significant enough to require Superman’s complete focus. However, the danger has escalated with the emergence of the Secret Order of Mad Scientists, who are former foes of Lex Luthor. They have intensified the threat by designing and generating multiple iterations of Parasite that have been altered. These new variations quickly overpower and deplete Superman’s strength.
