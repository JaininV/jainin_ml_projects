Reddit user ‘bluGill’ said: “Until you go on a few cruises, you don’t know what you like. Start with the ship deck plan though. If you don’t know what is near your cabin, you can’t make a good choice.”

Guests can usually find the ship’s deck plan on the cruise line’s website and it should have all the room numbers on.

Different decks will have different activities and guests can choose a room near the restaurant or another amenity such as the pool.

Rooms on higher floors could be more expensive even if the cabin is the same size as one on a lower deck.
