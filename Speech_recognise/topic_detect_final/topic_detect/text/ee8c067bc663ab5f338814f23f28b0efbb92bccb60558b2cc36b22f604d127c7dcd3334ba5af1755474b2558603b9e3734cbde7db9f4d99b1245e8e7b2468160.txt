Hello again,

This is a one-day-time frame analysis for GALAUSDT

Clearly, R2 is a resistance area in the current chart with its presentation of the disability of the price to rise at several points. R1 used to be a long-term support area. S1 used to be a resistance line. And S2 is a support area at the bottom that contains the support of price at different points. According to the past behavior of price, it could have a noticeable rise after being in a fluctuation at its lowest amount and by reaching R2, it face another rejection down to S2. Then by receiving the support there, the price was capable of having a great rise and could break S1 upward. At the present, the price has a fluctuation below R1 and we predict it to experience more rise up to R1 and after a pull back, another increase is waiting for it toward R2. We must wait for some confirmation candles to rise and an increase would be there for the price to reach higher amounts. It is even possible that the price loses the support at any points or even falls below S1 and via giving us some falling signs, more decline will definitely be waiting for the price toward lower amounts. S2 is believed a perfect point for putting trade orders but we should wait for the price to move toward it and then in our future updates, we will provide specific details for you. It is highly recommended to be cautious about various points and details and remember that for enjoying less risky trades. You can obtain every piece of information and details through our analyses and updates.
