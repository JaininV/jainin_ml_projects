San Francisco, April 19: Meta (formerly Facebook) is reportedly set to begin another round of mass layoffs on Wednesday that will affect at least 4,000 highly-skilled employees, the media reported.

This week's layoffs could be in the range of 4,000 jobs, according to a report in Vox, citing sources. In March, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced the company would cut 10,000 jobs in the coming months. Meta Layoffs: Facebook Parent Company to Sack More Employees This Week.

In an internal memo seen by The Washington Post, Meta said that "the company will begin notifying employees on its technical teams whose jobs are being cut". Meta will also announce newly reorganised teams and management hierarchies, the report mentioned.

"Facebook parent company Meta will announce details about new job cuts on Wednesday, part of a months-long downsizing and restructuring effort that will trim 10,000 employees amid multiple waves of layoffs," The Washington Post tweeted on Wednesday. In March, Zuckerberg announced to sack an additional 10,000 employees via several job cut rounds in the coming months. Accenture Layoff: Tech Layoffs Deepens As IT Firm Announces 19,000 Jobs Cuts, Delays Freshers Recruitments; Top Five Points.
