KUALA LUMPUR, April 18 ― Despite living abroad and visiting many countries over the past few decades, Tan Sri Michelle Yeoh believes the beauty and diversity of Malaysia played an important role in shaping who she is today.

The Ipoh-born actress said the beauty of Malaysia was that it was a multi-racial country.

“We have learnt to live and embrace each other's culture and I think that has fundamentally made me such an international person,” she said at her first press conference in Malaysia at Pavilion Kuala Lumpur following her win at the Oscars.

Yeoh said because of that she was able to see people as equals and learn from them.

“In Malaysia, we learnt how to learn from our Malay, Indian and Chinese friends.”

The 60-year-old Academy Awards-winning actress said being brought up in such an environment made her much more open, giving and accepting.

“That's what we should all do for each other, to accept what we are.

“We should be different, and it's the difference that makes us so complex, vibrant and dynamic.”

Yeoh also paid a tribute to the beauty her hometown, saying that she was brought up in a beautiful environment surrounded by rivers, mountains and nature.

“I grew up in a very rich environment from nature to people and to understand diversity.”
