Casemate Group, the indie publisher and distributor which specializes in publishing books in various history categories, has launched Brookline Books, a new imprint dedicated to publishing the history of southeast Pennsylvania and the greater Delaware Valley area. Casemate is located just outside of Philadelphia, in Havertown, Pa.

The imprint will be headed by Jennifer Green who joined Casemate last year and is Brookline Books commissioning editor. In addition to her role at Casemate, Green is the director of education for the Chester County History Center and holds an MA in American History from West Chester University of Pennsylvania.

Green is also the author of Brookline’s first book,  Dark History of Penn's Woods, which was first published by Casemate in September 2021. Her sequel Dark History of Penn's Woods, Vol. 2 will be one of the books in Brookline Books’ first list, which will be released starting in August. The first title in the list is a young adult nonfiction book,  Charley, the story of the youngest soldier to die during the American Civil War, by local historian Brendan Lyons. Four other titles are currently set to be published under the imprint and Casement aims to release five to seven titles annually, all focused on the history of greater Philadelphia.

“Brookline expands upon Casemate’s dedication to publishing quality history, and we’re proud to provide history lovers with stories that come from our own backyard. We’ve been working closely with local historians to shed light on Pennsylvanians’ stories,” said Casemate president David Farnsworth in a statement.
