As a three-alarm fire tears through a building on a busy street in Westchester, authorities are warning residents to avoid the area.

The fire started in the area of 16 South Main St. (Route 1) in Port Chester late Monday morning, April 17, the Port Chester Fire Department announced around 11 a.m.

As firefighters battle the blaze, they are warning people to stay away from the area.

The fire caused a 10:37 a.m. Metro-North train from Grand Central to Stamford to bypass Rye, Port Chester, and Greenwich. Affected customers can transfer for return service at the Cos Cob station, MTA officials said.

The fire caused Port Chester village officials to issue a warning to residents.

"This fire event is extremely dangerous," officials said, adding that numerous streets in the area of the fire have been shut down.

More information about the blaze is expected to be released by authorities shortly.
