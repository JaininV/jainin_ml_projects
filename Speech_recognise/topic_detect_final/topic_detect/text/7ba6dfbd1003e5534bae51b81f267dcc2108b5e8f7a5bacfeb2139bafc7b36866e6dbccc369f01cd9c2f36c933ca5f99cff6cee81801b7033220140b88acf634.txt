Kyle Kuzma’s tweet about the Miami Heat got fans clamoring for one player — Damian Lillard.

The Heat suffered a 116-105 defeat to the Atlanta Hawks after a disappointing performance in their Play-In game on Tuesday.

Miami was poor on the offensive glass throughout the game. Offensively, aside from Kyle Lowry’s 33 points on 11-of-16 shooting, they shot just 37.3 percent from the field.

Their shooting as a whole has been poor throughout the season and during the loss to the Hawks. Washington Wizards star Kyle Kuzma gave his thoughts on exactly what they needed.

That led to a number of fans as well as NBA veteran Brandon Jennings replying with one name in particular — Portland Trail Blazers star Damian Lillard.

That’s why they should have pursued someone like Dame, Kyrie, KD, or Donovan Mitchell but nah gotta stock up on the undrafted players

Lillard’s loyalty to Portland is unquestioned. However, it appears an exit is closer now more than ever given their disappointing 2022-23 campaign where they failed to even make the Play-In tournament.

But even if Lillard to Miami is a possibility, the Heat are well over the salary cap next season and would need to send plenty of assets to land the Blazers star — with one potential trade package including the likes of Tyler Herro, Duncan Robinson, Nikola Jovic and two future first-rounders.

For now, Miami’s focus will be on making the playoffs.

They still have another chance of doing just that, but it will have to be as the No. 8 seed if they manage to beat the winner of Wednesday’s Toronto Raptors vs. Chicago Bulls game.

Should they make it as the No. 8 seed, a first-round series with Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Milwaukee Bucks will be in store for them.
