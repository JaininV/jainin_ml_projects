This homemade cherry jam recipe is a flavor that’s not commonly available in supermarkets. It captures the flavor of your favorite summertime fruit in a spread that might bring to mind rural farm stands. You’ll be happy to have this in your pantry!

This strawberry jam recipe is another favorite.

Fresh cherries typically begin showing up in markets in May, and are available through June or July, making them one of the first fruits of the season. Dive right in and make a batch of this easy jam made with just a handful of ingredients.

If you’ve never made jam before, fret not. It’s easy! You can follow the instructions here for canning the jam to make a shelf stable product, save it as freezer jam, or if you go through fruit spreads quickly at your house, simply put it directly in the fridge. (Unprocessed jam will last in the fridge for about a month.)

Canning the jam allows you to tuck it away to give as gifts during the holiday gift giving season. Future you is going to be so impressed with today you!

You’ll need to remove the single pit from each cherry, so there’s a little bit more prep work required for this recipe than some of my other jam recipes.

A cherry pitter is a specialized tool used for doing this job, but you don’t have to rush and and buy one. If you don’t have one, there are a couple of other ways to remove the pit. Remove the stems, and try one of these methods:

Since you’ll be dicing the cherries up, they don’t need to be pretty, so you can simply use your hands to squeeze the cherry open and remove the pit.

Place each cherry atop a narrow-necked bottle (like a wine bottle) with the stem end up. Use a chopstick to push through the stem end, forcing the pit out the other end and down into the bottle. See it here.

Cherries  — This recipe calls for sweet cherries rather than sour cherries. Bing and Royal Ann are two varieties that are commonly available, but other sweet cherry varieties work just fine. Note that the color of the jam will vary based on the color of the cherries. Can you use frozen cherries? You certainly can.

Sugar — Use your favorite brand of granulated cane sugar. I prefer organic.

Lemon juice – Use bottled lemon juice to assure that the resulting pH for this recipe falls within safe canning guidelines.

Lemon zest – Adding lemon zest to the jam provides an extra burst of lemony flavor.

Pectin – This recipe is made using Pomona’s Universal Pectin. This is the only pectin I use anymore as it allows me to use much less sugar. The standard pectin brands just use too much sugar in my opinion, often requiring equal amounts of sugar and fruit! This low sugar pectin works a little differently, but makes a delicious, fruit-forward jam.

Start by measuring out the cherries. You’ll need about seven cups of fresh cherries to make enough diced fruit for this recipe. Pit and dice the fruit, then heat in a large saucepan along with the lemon juice, lemon zest, and calcium water.

Combine the pectin with the sweetener, making sure it’s thoroughly combined.

When the cherry mixture is boiling, add the sugar mixture, stirring for a minute or two to assure that the pectin is well distributed. Return to a boil and it’s done!

You’ll need special canning jars, lids, and rings (read more about canning equipment here) to make this homemade jam shelf-stable, but the process isn’t difficult.

Use quarter-pint or half pint jars for this recipe.

Once the jars are filled, you’ll process them in a water bath. What this means is you’ll put the filled and sealed jars of jam into boiling water and heat them for ten minutes. This assures that the jars will seal well.

You might be able to use a large pot, rather than a special water bath canner.

Place hot jars on a countertop lined with a kitchen towel and allow to cool fully. As they cool, you��ll hear the little “tink” sound of the jars sealing. Store any unsealed jars in the fridge and use those first. (This is unusual, but it does happen once in awhile.)

Remove the ring from each sealed jar, rinse to remove any jam residue, and store (without the ring) in a cool, dry place, such as the pantry.
