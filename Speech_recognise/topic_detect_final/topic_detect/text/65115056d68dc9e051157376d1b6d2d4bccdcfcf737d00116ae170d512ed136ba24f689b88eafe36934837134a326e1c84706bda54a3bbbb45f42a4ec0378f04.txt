Can someone please help me please.

I have lots of randomization sets, but would like to replace the entry values with names in the tables.

I can go to the find and replace route, but that will take forever to change 15 entries x 4 reps in hundreds of sheets

I attached a sample excel file with 3 sheets.

On Sheet one the fields that is colored green is what I have on each sheet.

The cells in yellow is what I need to be generated.

And that is where my ignorance come into play.

What do I need to do, to be able to do this quick and correctly on lots of sheets?

Thanx in advance.
