"I'll rent versus buying because of the overall cost. First, you have the interest which is tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars — which is all you pay for the first several years which means you’ll be upside-down for a long time. Then, some people seem to forget you need to put at least 2% aside for a maintenance fund because something WILL go wrong. Then, you need to have all of the proper insurance to keep yourself covered and hope the insurance company doesn’t find a loophole when the time comes (oh, and they will try VERY hard to find one). Then, you’ll always have the property tax to pay. And of course, the mortgage which requires a 30-odd year commitment which is like half of your adult life (sure you can resell it, but your actual profits after subtracting all the money you spent maintaining it will be smaller than you think). Meanwhile, the thing you’ve put so much money into is slowly rotting away."
