This delicious and healthy pearl couscous with roasted vegetables recipe is a flavor packed side dish that’s easy to make.

Here’s another clean out the fridge & pantry recipe. I had a box of pearl couscous (aka Israeli couscous) that had been sitting in the pantry for far too long so I grabbed it and then rummaged through the fridge to see what veggies I had on hand. I found some mushrooms, broccoli, cauliflower, asparagus, bell pepper, and onion. I roasted the veggies while I cooked the pearl couscous per the package instructions. I tossed everything together with some fresh lemon juice and toasted pine nuts and it turned out to be a really tasty side dish that paired nicely with lemon chicken and a garden salad.

Roast the veggies by tossing the  mushrooms, broccoli florets, cauliflower florets, asparagus, bell pepper,  and onion with olive oil then season with sea salt, freshly cracked pepper, and crushed red pepper flakes, to taste. Toss to evenly coat.

Place into the oven and roast for 10 minutes. Toss the veggies with a spatula then continue to roast for another 5-10 minutes or until the veggies are tender and a bit charred.

Remove from the oven and squeeze a fresh lemon wedge (or two) over the veggies then stir to evenly coat them; set aside until needed.

Make the pearl couscous per the package instructions while the veggies are roasting.

Combine the roasted veggies & cooked peal couscous together along with the toasted pine nuts, juice & zest from 1 lemon (or more), and some fresh parsley; stir until evenly combined. Taste & season with sea salt & freshly cracked pepper or lemon juice, if needed.  Serve and enjoy.
