Although some of us can't enjoy warm weather all year round, there are cold-tolerant tropical plants we can introduce into our garden to keep the spirit of summer going! Most of us living in zones 1-6 are accustomed to watching our plants go dormant in the winter, and they do this to make it through the cold conditions so that they can grow back around the same time each year.

However, winter can be a dreary season, especially when there aren't any beautiful plants to give our yards a bit of color. Luckily, there are a plethora of options available to keep our properties looking alive, such as the lusciously green Japanese fiber banana plants (Musa basjoo), which can grow up to 15 feet tall and survive negative 20-degree temperatures. We'll list 12 other hardy, beautiful plants, their maintenance requirements, and what to expect once you've committed to the tropical plant parent life.
