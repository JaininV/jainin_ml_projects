Camp Lejeune lawyers have joined with the government’s attorneys to file a joint memorandum requesting coordination or partial consolidation and the issuance of an initial case management order for all Camp Lejeune Justice Act of 2022 lawsuits.  If this motion is granted, there will technically not be a Camp Lejuene class action lawsuit.  But consolidation would bring many of the features of a class action lawsuit.

The Camp Lejeune Justice Act (CLJA), enacted on August 10, 2022, has led to lawsuits filed by individuals exposed to contaminated water at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, between August 1, 1953, and December 31, 1987. The Act, part of the Honoring Our PACT Act, allows individuals, including veterans, to seek relief for harm caused by exposure to contaminated water even though the statute of limitations on these claims has already passed.
