Ghanaian gospel singer Prophet Joseph Atarah has officially launched his debut headline concert dubbed the ‘Atarah Praise’ concert t be held in May.

The concert is set to feature many of Ghana’s gospel greats including current buzzing singer Piesie Esther.

Speaking at the media launch held yesterday in Accra, Prophet Atarah assured patrons will experience God descend on the night of praise and worship.

He said “You’re going to see Prophet Atarah moving in prophetic, singing, playing the instrument, and dancing as well. If you haven’t seen a prophet singing, dancing, and playing instruments, come on the 28th of May and you will see al these.

“God will descend, and God will be God and his people will be his people.”

Touching on his decision to hold a concert, the ”Woye Odo’ hitmaker explained that he has been in the music industry for about one year and six months and the support he has received was overwhelming.

He indicated “Doing this program, what motivated me is if I look back at what God has done in my life for seventeen years in the gospel ministry, it’s not been easy and also joining the gospel music industry for less than two years. But God has blessed me with both the prophetic and the singing and this baffles me and it makes me humble because of that, I decided to praise Go. But I can’t praise him alone so I want to mobilize people so we can come together and lift our hands together and praise him.”

He also asked attendees to come to the event with an expectation “Anytime people of God gather, heaven descends and as we’re going to gather and praise God I believe heaven will descend. When the Apostles met and prayed, the Bible said the fire came down from heaven. So, as the saints are going to gather and pray I believe heaven will descend and anybody that is coming should come with an expectation and I know your expectation will be met.

“I thank all the musicians in the gospel ministry for the way they have accepted me,” he added.
