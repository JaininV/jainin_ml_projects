(New York, NY) â€” After settling a defamation lawsuit from Dominion Voting Systems for more than three-quarters of a billion dollars, Fox News still faces a two-point-seven-billion-dollar lawsuit from another voting technology company. Smartmatic says Fox News spread lies that decimated its business. The company filed the suit in February of 2021, alleging that Fox shared false claims from former President Donald Trump and his supporters that the company played a role in his 2020 election loss.
