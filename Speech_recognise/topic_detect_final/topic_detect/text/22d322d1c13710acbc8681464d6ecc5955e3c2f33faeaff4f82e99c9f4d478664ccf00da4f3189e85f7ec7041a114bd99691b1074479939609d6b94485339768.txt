Diaz was included in a Reds matchday squad for the first time since October, ending his knee injury lay-off by taking a place on the bench against Leeds United.

The No.23 was then introduced as a substitute on 81 minutes by Jürgen Klopp as the visitors racked up a 6-1 victory in the Premier League.

“So happy to be back, amazing three points,” posted Diaz on social media following the win, which saw Cody Gakpo, Mohamed Salah (two), Diogo Jota (two) and Darwin Nunez provide the goals.
