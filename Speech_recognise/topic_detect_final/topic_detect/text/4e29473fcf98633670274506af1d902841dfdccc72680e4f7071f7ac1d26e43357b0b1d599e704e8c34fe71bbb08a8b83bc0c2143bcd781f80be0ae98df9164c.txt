GIO Pabualan demonstrated his class, leading Far Eastern University to an 8-0 rout over University of the East and remain in the top four of the UAAP Season 85 Men’s Football Tournament, Sunday at the UP Diliman Football Field.

Pabualan, a Bukidnon native, scored goals in the 52nd and 59th minutes of the match. He also provided assists for the headers of RJ Pescadera, Mel Anthony Baylon, and Viejay Frigillano in the 14th, 33rd, and 45+2 minutes, respectively.

“Everybody knows there’s that talent in Gio,” said Tamaraws coach Vince Santos. “He showed it today. Maybe it’s just getting it more consistent from him.”

After failing to win their past three matches, the Tamaraws are now in third place with 15 points on the back of four wins, three draws, and two defeats, and a superior goal difference of plus-15.

Geri Martini Rey and Stephen Soria added goals in the 54th and 57th minutes while Karl Absalon completed the rout in the 72nd minute with a shot from outside the box.

“It’s good to finally have conversions on the number of attempts we created today. I think that’s been the difference. In the past few games, we’ve had the chances but there were a lot of sorry misses. We focused on this coming into the game. Just happy for the boys today,” added Santos.

The Red Warriors’ woes were further compounded in the 67th minute after Edmar Adonis was dismissed for getting his second yellow card of the match.

UE is in fourth place with 15 points behind four wins, three draws, and two defeats as well as a goal difference of minus-1.

UE will take on University of Santo Tomas this Thursday at 6:30 PM. FEU will return to action next Sunday against De La Salle University at 6:30 PM.
