Daniil Medvedev recently shared adorable pictures from his daughter’s baptism ceremony, which also had his colleagues Andrey Rublev and Karen Khachanov as guests.

Medvedev and his wife Daria welcomed their first child, daughter Alisa, on October 14, 2022.

The Russian tennis player, who resides in Monaco with his family, organized a baptism ceremony for his sixth-month-old daughter, just before the recently concluded Monte-Carlo Masters.

Medvedev’s colleagues and friends Andrey Rublev and Karen Khachanov were also present as guests to mark the special event. In fact, it was revealed that Andrey Rublev is now part of Medvedev’s family after accepting the role of Alisa’s godfather.

On Tuesday, April 18, Daniil Medvedev took to social media to share a first glimpse of his daughter as he showcased pictures from her baptism ceremony.

In the first snap, the 27-year-old and his family posed with godmother and godfather Andrey Rublev.

Rublev recently revealed his duties as a godfather to his compatriot’s daughter. The Monte-Carlo Masters champion stated that he is responsible for nurturing Alisa’s belief in God, inculcating kindness in her, and also has to pray for her wellbeing every day.

The Russian also joked that he thus had more responsibilities towards the child than her father Daniil Medvedev.

Daniil Medvedev was recently asked who his best friends on tour were. The 2021 US Open champion revealed that he is close with his compatriots, including Andrey Rublev and Karen Khachanov, as well as Belarus’ Ilya Ivashka.

The former World No. 1 went on to call his friends “kind, happy and fun” and stated that the group has been together since their junior days. Medvedev added that as they are in the same profession, they have an unbreakable bond.
