During season 13 of the Real Housewives of New Jersey, we found out why Joe Gorga has resentment towards his now brother in law, Louie Ruelas.

It boiled down to Joe Gorga coming to Louie with a thin crust pizza oven idea that they were going to even do a monthly subscription on. The same oven is sold at Colombia Inn Restaurant located in Montville, New Jersey. That’s where Joe Gorga got the idea originally. The restaurant is known for shipping these ovens directly to your doorstep.

The restaurants website writes, “Columbia Inn ships our famous thin-crust pizza nationwide with Goldbelly—straight from Montville, NJ right to your doorstep”

When Joe Gorga presented Louie with the idea – he thought it was a good idea and bought all the pizza ovens. Louie then started working on the marketing and logistics of everything. Louie spent over $200,000 dollars and Joe Gorga expected 50% of the business because it was idea and because he was a celebrity so he didn’t need to put any money in. Louie disagreed getting an attorney on board and offered 5% then 10%.

Prior to that – Louie  discussed naming the pizza ovens Skinny Italian because of Teresa’s New York best selling cookbook and the fact that it was thin crust pizza.

When Joe refused to invest actual money in the pizza oven business, Louie didn’t steal the idea.  Instead, he lost the money and donated some pizza ovens while storing the rest in a warehouse.

One of the donated pizzas got on eBay where Instagram user yourmomsarewatching purchased it. The eBay account has zero relation to Teresa, Louie or anyone in their family.

Teresa never denied ordering the pizza ovens so it’s odd that Margaret Josephs is inserting herself in pizza gate when it has to do with Louie Ruelas and Joe Gorga.
