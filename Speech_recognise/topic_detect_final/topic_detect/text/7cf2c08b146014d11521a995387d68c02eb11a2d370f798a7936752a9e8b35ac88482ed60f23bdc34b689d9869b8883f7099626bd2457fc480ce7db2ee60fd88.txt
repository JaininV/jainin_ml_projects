The Brazilian Championship’s Serie B has announced a sponsorship deal with the Brazilian online sports betting firm, Betano. With this deal, the competition will now be known as Serie B Betano for the rest of the season.

Following its success with the Supercopa do Brasil and Copa do Brasil 2023 in January, the multinational bookmaker, Betano earned the naming rights to Brazil’s second football division.

The sports betting firm will develop several fan engagement efforts including LED lighting and pre-match festivities, as part of the new agreement, while also gaining major brand exposure on and off the pitch. Another instance will include the Betano branding on the teams’ admission protocol as well as the tournament trophies.

Alexandre Fonseca, Country Manager for Betano in Brazil, said, “Conquering space not only as an official sponsor of the 2023 Brazilian Championship, but also the naming rights and official sponsorship of Série B reflects how much football, as a national passion, also represents one of the main pillars of Betano in the promotion of the sports industry. We are very happy with the news, which brings us even closer to the public and reflects all the strength and confidence we have in the sports betting market.”

Marly Yamamoto, Director of Marketing and Customer Management at Assaí, said, “The renewal of the sponsorship of the country’s main football championship strengthens Assaí’s growing role in tournaments throughout Brazil. We know that football is part of the national identity, it brings us together and connects us with each other.”
