Lately, I’ve been making refreshing acai bowls with everything local and good, recipe testing matcha cakes, perfecting my caramelized banana recipe, and baking off a whole bunch of Russian Easter cakes (kulich).

Leaving this here for some inspiration for the spring and summer months to come. The recipes – and many of them also have accompanying videos! – are all over on my Instagram channel.
