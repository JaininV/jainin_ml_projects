Robert Irwin and new girlfriend Rorie Buckey have taken their relationship to the next level after a romantic getaway to Perth.

Irwin, son of The Crocodile Hunter’ legend Steve, was spotted at Perth Airport on April 6, ahead of an Easter holiday with his new romance.

Iwrin, 19, had flown in from Queensland, where he works at the family-owned Australia Zoo, for a trip to get to know Buckey’s family, who call Perth home.

Buckey’s mum Kate owns a media production company, while her father Nathan runs a floor-covering business in Perth.

Irwin greeted Buckey, 18, at the airport in a casual white tee and dark wash jeans, swapping out his signature khaki uniform.

Buckey rocked a gorgeous white sundress and sandals, with a golden ‘R’ bangle and electric blue bag designed by Poppy Lissiman, who is a Perth-born Australian designer.

The pair look absolutely smitten, as they packed on the PDA walking through the Perth Airport, where they couldn’t keep their eyes off each other.

Buckey, the niece of the late Hollywood star Heath Ledger, took her beau to her family’s car, where her dad kindly helped Iwrin load his luggage into the boot.

The lovebirds were rumoured to have started their relationship in November 2022, after being spotted on a romantic beach walk along Brisbane’s coast, before watching the sunset and cuddling up together.

This sighting late last year ended speculation surrounding Irwin and Lucia Field, the daughter of the Blue Wiggle Anthony Field.

It’s reported the pair have remained close, Lucia working as the female Blue Wiggle now herself.

Irwin already has the tick of approval from Buckey’s dad, Nathan.

In an interview with the Daily Mail, when asked if he approved of the relationship, Mr Buckey said: “Of course, absolutely”.
