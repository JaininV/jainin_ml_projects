The phone footage shows one of the men saying: "As you can see we're doing some roofing work here. We're doing some bodging.

The builder continued: ''We've got two vans on the go - and as you can see, the guy we're working for, he's really old."

To really put salt in the wound, the individual in question then calls out to John, mocking him for his complete trust in the criminal labourers.

He went on to poke fun out of the pensioner, adding: "It's your home, you need to live in it. So you don't want any more problems on the roof after we're gone, do you?"

The camera then pans to the poorly repaired roof, as the cameraman notes: "As you can see here, we don't need to pay thousands for advertisement."

Opening up a little more about the criminal scheme, the builder revealed: "It's on the door-to-door knocking, what I've done for all my life, and we find guys like this every day.

However, after the three criminal builders faced some pretty serious consequences for their scam, it's clear that their antics were the farthest thing from 'the way forward'.

John's son Steve told the BBC that the group were 'despicable', and that he believed the death of his mother had been in part due to the fraud.

Matty was jailed for two years and three months for the offence and, at just 16-years-old at the time, he was one of the youngest offenders Wiltshire Trading Standards had ever discovered.
