Liverpool return to action on Saturday afternoon when they square off against Nottingham Forest in the Premier League.

Having gone four matches without success in the top flight, Jurgen Klopp's side returned to winning ways on Monday when they thrashed Leeds United by a 6-1 scoreline at Elland Road.

Liverpool are now back to within nine points of the Champions League places, yet they face a Forest side, albeit struggling, who are motivated to move outside of the relegation zone.

Here, Sports Mole rounds up Liverpool's latest injury and suspension news ahead of welcoming Steve Cooper's side to Merseyside.

Teenage right-back Calvin Ramsay is on the mend from a knee operation, but the former Aberdeen youngster will not play again this season as he rehabilitates for the next several weeks.

Ramsay's fellow youngster Stefan Bajcetic's breakthrough year at Anfield was cut short by a serious adductor problem last month, and the Spanish starlet is also sidelined for the remainder of the campaign.

The ill-fated Naby Keita returned from March's international fixtures nursing yet another muscular injury, and no timeframe has been placed on his recovery, but there are fears that he could have played his final game in a Liverpool shirt ahead of his contract expiry this summer.

Liverpool have no players suspended for this match.
