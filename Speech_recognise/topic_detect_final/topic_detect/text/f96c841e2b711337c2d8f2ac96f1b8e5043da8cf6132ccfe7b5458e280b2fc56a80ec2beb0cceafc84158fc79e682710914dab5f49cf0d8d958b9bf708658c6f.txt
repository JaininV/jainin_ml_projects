Ndaba started dancing as a child, growing up in Durban when South Africa was still under an apartheid regime. “Dancing isn’t something I had to dig for,” she tells me. “It’s something I was born with, I think.” When her mother was out in town shopping, Ndaba would push all the furniture to the side and start choreographing short routines. It was already a collaborative affair; she had girlfriends posted at the gate, the door, and the bus stop, with whistles, little spies ready to call out when her mother was returning. “That way we could make the place spick and span before she returned,” Ndaba says laughing. “She didn’t know we were using her kitchen as a studio.”

As a high school student, Ndaba started taking dance classes at a local university. She was good enough to get scouted by Alfred Hinkel and sent to Cape Town, where she worked on the set of “Sarafina!” For ten years, she danced with Jazzart, before leaving to teach in Durban and Johannesburg. “My target was people who have left school but don’t know where to go next,” Ndaba explains. “When I was looking for dancers I would go to the supermarkets and give pamphlets to the old mamas and say “I know you have someone at home who isn’t doing anything.”
