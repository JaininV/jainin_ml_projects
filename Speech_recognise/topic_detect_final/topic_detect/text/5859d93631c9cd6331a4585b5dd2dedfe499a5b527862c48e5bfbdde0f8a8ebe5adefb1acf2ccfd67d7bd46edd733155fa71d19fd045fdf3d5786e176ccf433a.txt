I've been passionate about sending humans into space since I was eight years old, so becoming a mission operations engineer at SpaceX in 2009 was a lifetime achievement for me.

Out of the 20 employees in the mission operations team, I was the only trainer. My role involved writing, training, preparing astronauts, testing software, analyzing data, and more.

The astronauts couldn't stay at SpaceX's headquarters in Hawthorne, California, for multiple weeks at a time, as they had to travel around for ISS training. That meant I developed a set of different lesson plans that each lasted a week.

Before I was offered the job, I was interviewed by Musk, who used to interview every applicant vying for a position at SpaceX. I often saw him in the office but we didn't speak directly.
