Animated film The Super Mario Bros. Movie, released on April 5, grossed over $500 million, including $260.3 million domestically and $248.4 million internationally.

It is now the highest-grossing film of 2023 in both global and US box office. More importantly, it also makes The Super Mario Bros. Movie is the largest video game adaptation in history, surpassing Warcraft and Pokemon: Detective Pikachu over the same period.

Animated film The Super Mario Bros. Movie was created by Universal, Illumination and Nintendo. The delay was caused by Nintendo’s indecision after the 1993 adaptation flopped and was derided as one of the worst films ever made.

But Illumination, which created the Despicable Me and Sing franchises, stood its ground. Illumination founder Chris Meledandri co-produced the film with Shigeru Miyamoto, the legendary Nintendo designer who created the Mario universe alongside classics such as Zelda and Donkey Kong.

The characters were voiced by Chris Pratt, Charlie Day, Anya Taylor-Joy and Jack Black. Its production budget is $100 million. Pixar and Disney animated films, for example, often cost twice as much.

The film became the second highest-grossing animated film since 2019 at the global box office, surpassing Demon Slayer: Mugen Train ($494 million) and behind Minions: Rise of Gru ($942.5 million).
