The mountaineering season in the Alaska Range has begun! Yesterday we launched our first course of the season; six skiers and two guides flew in for a 7-day Ski Mountaineering Course.

They spent the day at AMS HQ reviewing gear, practicing fixed line ascension and having a hearty lunch before flying at 4:00 pm.

They will be exploring Glacier One, the first glacier as you head up the massive Ruth Glacier. There are loads of places to explore and lots of learning in a spectacular setting.
