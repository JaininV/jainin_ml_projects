And his Suns need a win to even the series vs. the Clippers on Tuesday night

Chris Paul has had awful fortunes under referee Scott Foster in the playoffs

Chris Paul and the Suns will try to tie up their series with the Clippers on Tuesday night, but an unbelievable losing streak hangs over the point guard ahead of Game 2.

The 37-year-old has lost the last 14 playoff games he's played that were officiated by referee Scott Foster, and the issues between the pair go back years.

Back in 2008, Foster officiated Paul and the Hornets' Game 7 loss to the Spurs.

And he apparently chose to remind the guard of that fact when the two shared the court in the 2020 postseason, according to ESPN's Marc Spears, as the Thunder fell in a Game 7 as well.

Paul took notice of his poor fortunes under Foster over the years, publicly criticizing the official on multiple occasions.

After receiving a technical foul in the 2017-18 regular season, Paul said the decision was 'Scott Foster at his finest.'

And Paul complained about him again the following season saying he [didn't] know what else to do' in regards to Foster's officiating after a playoff loss with the Rockets.

It's not just Paul that shares these opinions.

The prickly Foster was named the NBA's worst referee in an anonymous player poll from The Athletic on Tuesday, earning 25.4 percent of the vote.

Nonetheless, Foster has worked in 23 Finals series and will be at the helm Tuesday as the Suns attempt to get back on track.

Paul, Devin Booker, Kevin Durant and DeAndre Ayton suffered a surprise loss to a Paul George-less Clippers team in Game 1, falling 115-110.

Game 2 will take place in Phoenix once again before the series goes to LA.
