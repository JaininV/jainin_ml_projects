This is an interview I did with Bill DeWees a few weeks ago that I thought you might find interesting. Bill and I have worked on several projects in the past and decided it might be helpful to talk about some of the challenges e-Learning developers have when working with voice-over talent. At the end of the interview, we discussed a free course he and I co-authored. That course is now available. Check it out if you want to learn more about working with professional voice-over narrators.
