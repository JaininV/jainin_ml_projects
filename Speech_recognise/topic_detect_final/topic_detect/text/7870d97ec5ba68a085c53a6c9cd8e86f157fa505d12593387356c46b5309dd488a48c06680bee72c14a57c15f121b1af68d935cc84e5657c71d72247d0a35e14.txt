Tottenham fans have been keeping a close eye on Destiny Udogie this season as they prepare to welcome the Italian to N17.

Spurs wrapped up a £15m deal for the 20-year-old in August 2022 before loaning him back to Udinese for the 2022/23 campaign.

Udogie‘s move to Tottenham came after he impressively scored five goals and provided three assists in 35 Serie A appearances last season.

Now, we have been given some insight about what those at Spurs think of his displays this term.

Well, Udogie was branded “soft” by Tutto Mercato Web after a recent 1-1 draw against Verona.

However – according to 90min – Tottenham do not agree, and have been very impressed by the Italy international’s progress so far this season.

Udogie has almost matched his amount of goal involvements from last term with three goals and three assists in 25 Serie A outings this season, with his consistency from left-back really standing out.

90min add that the Udinese No.13 made a visit to the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Sunday 19th February as Spurs recorded a 2-0 win over West Ham.

Udinese have now found a replacement for Udogie in Jordan Zemura, so it seems all parties are set for the Italian wonderkid to make a big impact at Tottenham next season.

In our view, the timing is ideal for Udogie.

Tottenham do not currently own a standout left-back as the likes of Ivan Perisic and Ryan Sessegnon have struggled to nail down a starting role this season.

Sergio Reguilon also doesn’t appear to have much of a future in N17 as he struggles on loan with Atlético Madrid.

Therefore, that spot in the team is there for Udogie to claim as his own.

Tottenham will also have a new manager by the time Udogie arrives in north London, which represents a blank slate for the youngster to make a strong first impression.

Hopefully, the Verona-born wonderkid can live up to the hype at Tottenham next season.
