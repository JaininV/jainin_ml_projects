Esotericists say that pets can leave the house for several reasons.

One of them is that the animal feels its death, feels discomfort due to negative energy or anticipates some kind of misfortune.

But there is also another meaning. It is believed that sometimes pets that run away take misfortunes with them and save the owner and other family members.

Attention should also be paid to logical explanations.

Cats can leave homes where they are uncomfortable, for example, they are offended, malnourished, and also in cases where they have lost someone they considered their owner.

Moreover, the animal may simply be offended. This happens if another animal appeared in the house, which attracted all the attention.

A pregnant cat often leaves the house to calve. In this case, she will return, but bring new “tenants” with her.

If the cat has not been sterilized, then it can go in search of love.
