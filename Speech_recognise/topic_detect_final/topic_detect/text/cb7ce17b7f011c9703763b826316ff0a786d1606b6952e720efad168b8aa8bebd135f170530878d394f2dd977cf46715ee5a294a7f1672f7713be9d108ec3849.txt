Opinion: As a judge specializing in mental health cases, I know the system can improve — and how

Personally, I would love to see more services, more treatment, more beds, more compassion and more alternatives for individuals with mental health issues         Davis is a judge with the San Diego Superior Court, assigned to the downtown courthouse, specializing in mental health cases. She lives in San Diego. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. As a Superior Court judge specializing in mental health cases, I have the unique opportunity to view the intersection of mental health and the justice system from “the trenches.”You might be surprised how mental health issues weave their way through and touch on so many areas of the law. Mental health often determines whether, when and how cases proceed, as well as the restriction and restoration of important rights. For example, whether criminal defendants can be held for trial depends on their mental competency. Legal proceedings determine whether they will be released from a mental hospital at their request or receive treatments such as electroconvulsive therapy. Individuals who cannot take care of themselves may become subject to court-ordered conservatorships, permitting certain kinds of life and health decisions to be made for them by others. The Superior Court handles all of these kinds of cases.But in my years on the bench, hearing these types of cases, certain themes emerge. One common thread I have found is each person that has a mental health issue is a unique individual. The variety of issues, diagnoses, functionality, needs and community placement options differ so widely that any solution to our “mental health crisis” cannot be one-size-fits-all. Someone who is actively experiencing visual and auditory hallucinations, for example, is by no means the same as someone suffering from an anxiety disorder. Additionally, many are dual diagnosed, which means they have a substance use disorder along with mental illness, and the challenges of treating both conditions simultaneously cannot be understated. So we must be creative in our solutions. We need to tailor treatment and resources to the individual.Working within the existing system, I have seen the frustration of family and community members when, for example, an adult child violates a restraining or protective order and refuses treatment or medication. I have seen families who have run out of options, who must protect themselves through “tough love,” who throw up their hands in despair wishing that the system would do more.How can we improve the system? Personally, I would love to see more services, more treatment, more beds, more compassion and more alternatives for individuals with mental health issues.  Here is where a greater understanding of one judge’s perspective may be helpful. As judges, we work to maintain a delicate balance. Your adult child is an individual with his or her own constitutional rights and freedom to make choices. There is also a need to protect the community and to provide vital help and care when a tipping point is reached, and individuals are no longer able to make those choices for themselves. We view each person and each case as unique, which means that the process is not simple; complications and delays arise that can engender frustration and even anger. My personal goal in presiding over these cases is to honor and balance all of the competing interests with sensitivity in order to create the fairest and most constructive possible outcome.How can we improve the system? Personally, I would love to see more services, more treatment, more beds, more compassion and more alternatives for individuals with mental health issues.And that is why, when I get up and go to work every day, I am profoundly honored to be able to work with the court, behavioral health services, probation, the prosecution and defense, and all the agencies and individual contributors involved in our collaborative justice court.In San Diego County, the Behavioral Health Court program is a shining example of what the justice system can do to improve outcomes for justice-involved individuals who are living with mental illness. The program, which began in 2009, helps people move from jail to lives of self-sufficiency by diverting participants from prison to group homes, supported by wrap-around mental health services, formal probation and strict oversight by the court. All participants come to court monthly, and their progress and compliance is monitored and, more important, applauded.I have seen amazing transformations over the years. Many of our graduates first joined as felony offenders. They can be mentally unstable and often are homeless. And through commitment, hard work and insight, they graduate as self-sustaining and mentally stable to reunite with loved ones and move on to a much brighter future. Family members share, often tearfully, how grateful and proud they feel.I know that not all criminal defendants are appropriate for our community-based program, but the members who do participate (even if they do not make it all the way to graduation) leave better off as individuals and can face their future with more tools for success.So at the end of the day, when I head home from the courthouse, I know, in some small way, we helped make our community a better place for everyone.
