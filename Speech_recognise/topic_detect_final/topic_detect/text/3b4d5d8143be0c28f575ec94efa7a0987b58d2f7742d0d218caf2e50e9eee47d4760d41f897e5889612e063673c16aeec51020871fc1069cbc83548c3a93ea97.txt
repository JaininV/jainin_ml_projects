In upcoming scenes on the ITV soap, Stephen (played by Todd Boyce) orders Sally Metcalfe (Sally Dynevor) to pull out all the stops for the first Nippersnapper order, but the power suddenly goes off and the factory is plunged into darkness.

Later on, Stephen opens a hand-delivered letter which turns his blood cold.

The killer is horrified to find a single line reading: "I know what you did to Rufus."

Over at the Rovers, the killer struggles to get into a celebratory mood with the others as they drink to the second order.

When he goes back to the factory he is approached by the two men he tried to buy LSD from who reveal they sent the letter and want £10,000 or they’ll go to the police.
