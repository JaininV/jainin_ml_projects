*Sean “Diddy” Combs took the stage at Coachella Music Festival in Indio, CA on April 14, 2023, with a surprise performance during Metro Boomin‘s headlining set. Diddy joined Metro Boomin, The Weeknd, and 21 Savage with a version of the platinum hit “Creepin.”

Taking his smash hit to another level, Metro Boomin recently enlisted Diddy, who was featured on the original Bad Boy classic “I Don’t Wanna Know,” performed, written, and produced by former Bad Boy artist and hitman Mario Winans, for the release of the remix of his now platinum track “Creepin” with The Weeknd and 21 Savage.

Last month, Metro Boomin also dropped a star-studded video with Diddy, The Weeknd, and 21 Savage.

The visual pays homage to the original hit with special appearances from Mario Winans and R&B singer and actress Coco Jones.

The performance was a testament to Diddy’s status as a true icon in the music industry, exemplifying why he remains one of the most outstanding performers of his generation.
