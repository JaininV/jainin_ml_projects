The Macon School District last week announced Dale Devenport will be its next athletic director.

Devenport elaborates on his interest in the position.

Devenport will remain head boys basketball coach, which he says was non-negotiable.

He acknowledges it will be a lot to balance.

Outgoing Athletic Director Travis Mundahl has worked in the Macon district the last nine years.
