Mark your calendars, Big Blue Nation. Mark Stoops and the Kentucky coaching staff are hosting a big-time visitor this week, one that could plug a hole in the Big Blue Wall.

USC offensive tackle Courtland Ford just entered the transfer portal on Sunday, and it didn’t take long for the Wildcats to schedule a visit with the standout lineman. KSR’s Nick Roush is reporting that the 6-foot-5, 305-pound veteran will be on campus “later this week.��

Wrapping up his redshirt sophomore campaign in 2022, Ford could play three more years of college football with the COVID-19 eligibility waiver. He has played in 20 games across three seasons with the Trojans, starting in 12 — 11 at left tackle. Eight of his starts came as a sophomore in 2021 before earning the starting job out of camp in 2022. He earned three starts upon Lincoln Riley’s arrival last fall — one in the Cotton Bowl — but injuries paved way for Virginia transfer Bobby Haskins to emerge as the team’s main option at tackle.

The native of Cedar Hill, TX was a top-600 prospect overall and No. 60 overall tackle in the class of 2020, a consensus three-star. He chose USC over offers from Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee, TCU and Oregon, among others.

Riley said earlier this week Ford had “really improved his body” this offseason, despite being limited by a minor offseason procedure. Now, he immediately emerges as one of the top tackles in the transfer portal, with Kentucky quickly throwing its hat in the ring in hopes of landing his services.

And it comes at a crucial position for the Wildcats, with the program still searching for someone to claim the starting role at right tackle. Jeremy Flax, Deondre Buford, David Wohlabuagh and Josh Jones have all participated in the open competition, but no clear favorites.

Will Ford be the answer? The process begins this week when the 6-foot-5 lineman arrives on campus.
