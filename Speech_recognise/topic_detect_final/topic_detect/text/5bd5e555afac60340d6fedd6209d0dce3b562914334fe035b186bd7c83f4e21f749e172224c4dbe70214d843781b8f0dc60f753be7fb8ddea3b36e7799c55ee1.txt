The McGrath Institute’s  Echo Program  is delighted to announce and welcome 28 new students to the Class of Echo 20 who have made the commitment to serve the Church, engage in integrative formation, and work toward their Master of Arts in Theology for the next two years.

Students will pursue summer coursework through Notre Dame’s Department of Theology while serving in ministerial or teaching roles in parishes in addition to Catholic high schools and middle schools during the other nine months of the year. These students will serve in the Arch/Dioceses of Gary,

In addition, Echo has a record number of early commitments who have accepted offers to join the class of Echo 21. These seven students currently attend the University of Notre Dame, Holy Cross College, and the Catholic University of America, as well as two early admitants from India and Nigeria. We welcome the Class of Echo 20, and Echo 21, and are grateful for their ‘yes’ to learn and serve the Church.
