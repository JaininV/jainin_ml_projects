Spinomenal has announced the launch of its latest community competition, The Golden Era Tournament, inspired by the supplier’s Universe game crossover concept.

Beginning on April 27, the competition will see players compete for a share of a €150,000 prize pool with 12 new slot games set to be released especially for the tournament.

Nir Ronen, Spinomenal COO, commented: “The Golden Era tournament delivers a wonderfully engaging concept which is woven into the narrative of our Universe concept. Players will enjoy multiple titles from our portfolio that each build towards the chance of a mega win.”

Using an ancient Greek theme, players will accompany Goddess Athena as she travels through the games existing in the Spinomenal Universe. Throughout the competition, promotional games and bonus mini rounds will be triggered at multiple stages.

All Spinomenal-affiliated operators that are set to take part in The Golden Era Tournament will receive tournament tools to run the promotion, in addition to a full activity package to drive community interest during the campaign.

These operators will be able to run the tournament across over 190 Spinomenal Universe slots as players gain credit points from a total of 11 game rounds, each transporting players to a different world in the Spinomenal Universe.

Players will climb a leaderboard depending on how many credit points they can collect, with certain tasks to collect and point boosts also awarded in special Rush Hours rounds.
