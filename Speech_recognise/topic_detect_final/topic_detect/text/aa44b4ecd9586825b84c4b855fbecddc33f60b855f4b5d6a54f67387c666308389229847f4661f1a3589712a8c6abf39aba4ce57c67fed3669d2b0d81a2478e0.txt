Christian Williams is set to be double handed as he aims to hang onto the Coral Scottish Grand National trophy.

The Welsh wizard has kept ante-post favourite Kitty’s Light in the list of 31 five-day confirmations ahead of the Ayr showpiece. Kitty’s Light was runner-up to stablemate Win My Wings 12 months ago and Williams is also planning to send Swinley Chase winner Cap Du Nord. Unsurprisingly, Randox Grand National winner Corach Rambler was among 29 taken out of the race at the latest deadline with trainer Lucinda Russell relying on duo Your Own Story and Mighty Thunder, who claimed the race two years ago under Tom Scudamore.

Monbeg Genius, who finished third behind Corach at the Cheltenham Festival, also remains in contention for this weekend’s feature for Jonjo O’Neill. Top weight is likely to be shouldered by Dusart, who was pulled up on his last start behind Ahoy Senor in January’s Cotswold Chase and could become Nicky Henderson’s first runner in the race since 2018.

Pre-race favourite and defending champion Anna Bunina is amongst 22 left in the Coral Scottish Champion Hurdle for the John McConnell yard.
