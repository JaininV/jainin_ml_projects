David Tennant has confirmed that a show in the vein of Doctor Who Confidential is returning to the BBC.

The magazine show originally aired between 2005 and 2011 and offered a behind the scenes look at individual Doctor Who episodes.

There had been rumours of a return for such a show with the 60th anniversary specials later this year and Tennant appears to confirm them during a recent appearance at Galaxy Con.

During a talk at the convention, Tennant said: "It was all filmed by all the various Doctor Who Confidential-style people, so you'll see all that.

"But it was very exciting for us, for them to visit us on set."

Many fans have taken this as a sign that Doctor Who Confidential or a similar show with a different title will return to coincide with new episodes later this year.

One Doctor Who fan tweeted: "I was sad that the BBC got rid of #DoctorWho Confidential. It sounds good that something like it is coming back!"

Another said: "Tbh it would be more weird if there wasnt some type of behind the scenes for the 60th."

One fan posted fond memories of the original show: "This is the truly exciting i used to love doctor who confidential. extremely fond memories of watching it after an episode as a child to diffuse how scared i was of the monsters by showing the behind the scenes."

Doctor Who Confidential was hugely popular with fans and was voted the greatest BBC Three show of all time in 2013 in a poll conducted by the Radio Times.

It was usually narrated by a star of the show such as Tennant, Simon Pegg or Anthony Head.

The BBC have not yet confirmed the return of any Doctor Who shoulder programming.
