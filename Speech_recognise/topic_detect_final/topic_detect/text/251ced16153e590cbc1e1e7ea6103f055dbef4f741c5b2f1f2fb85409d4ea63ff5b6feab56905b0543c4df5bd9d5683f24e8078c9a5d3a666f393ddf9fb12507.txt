Barcelona's Monday night fixture against local rivals Girona in the 'derbi barcelonï¿½s' ended in a disappointing draw. With a win, Barca had the chance to go 15 points clear of Real Madrid at the top of the table, but instead extended their lead to 13 points after picking up a point. With ten games to play in the final stages of the season, there are 30 points up for grabs and unless the Catalan giants experience a historic slip up, the title is virtually all but decided.

Xavi also addressed rumors regarding what would be sensation return to the Camp Nou for Lionel Messi. Fans of the club have in recent games made their feelings known, having chanted the Argentinian's name in the 10th minute of the previous two home fixtures.

"About Leo, I think it generates great enthusiasm - the fans have chanted his name a couple of times now and the fact that he could come back to the club generates a great deal of excitement, but we will see how that goes and we just need to focus on the upcoming games and winning la Liga."

It remains to be seen if Barcelona's greatest ever player will make a fairytale return to the club. Messi's future is still to be decided, but it looks increasingly unlikely that the World Champion will not renew at current club PSG at the end of the season when his contract is up.
