The event was led by Altís Ludlam Trail’s current Artist in Residency, internationally recognized Colombian artist Hector Prado, known for his Pop art, and experimental and graphic design. During the event, Prado painted a women's beach sarong (cover-up), which was raffled off to one of the guests. Prado has garnered critical acclaim, earning recognition at the Cannes Festival and the Emmy Awards. He also received a special award for his artwork for Steven Spielberg’s HBO series "The Pacific."

The Altman Companies' Artist-in-Residency program supports the arts and provides a practicing South Florida artist with a one-year rent-free apartment and den space to practice and fine-tune their craft. In exchange, artists create and display their art on-site and engage with residents through monthly artistic events. The artists are selected based on their portfolio's quality, originality, creativity, craft, and artistic distinction.
