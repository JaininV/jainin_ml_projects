National Trails Day always takes place in the month of April to encourage people to get out and enjoy their local nature trails and Dallas County is taking part in the celebration.

The Raccoon River Valley Trail Board will be asking community members to join them on a relaxed-pace 16 mile leisure bike ride from Minburn to Perry and back to where the Raccoon River Valley Trail connects with the High Trestle Trail. The event will start at the Nineteen14 Depot in Minburn at 12:45pm on Saturday. No registration is required.

In the event of inclement weather the Raccoon River Valley Trail Board will make the decision by 11:00 AM that day on whether to ride and will post it on their Facebook page.
