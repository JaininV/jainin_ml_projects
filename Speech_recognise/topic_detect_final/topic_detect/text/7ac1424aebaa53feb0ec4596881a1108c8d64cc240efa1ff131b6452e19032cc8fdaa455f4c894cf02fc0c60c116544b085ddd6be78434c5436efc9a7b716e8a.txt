NEW PERSPECTIVES: HIDDEN COSMOPOLITANISM OF THE ARAB WORLD—A TWO-PART LECTURE BY KEN DORPH

Sag Harbor resident and Middle East expert, , will delivers a two-part lecture entitled , which examines the diversity of Arabs with a focus on their evolving views on religious minorities and gender.

As  illustrates, the US media present an image of Europe and Israel as beacons of pluralism and democracy with the Arab world narrowly summarized as ISIS. Ken has spent a good deal of his life in the Arab world, from Morocco to Iraq, and has lived the breathtaking diversity of the region. Ken will explore the surprising historical tolerance of the Arabs, which has been deeply and negatively impacted by Western intervention, the rise of the oil economy, and the conflicts with Israel. Ken will first ask the question: What is an Arab? And will then look at the diversity of the people called Arabs, with a focus on the evolving views on religious minorities and gender. Guests are left to ponder the fragility of a cosmopolitan society, how acceptance of diversity is undermined, and how we can help build a more caring and cosmopolitan world.
