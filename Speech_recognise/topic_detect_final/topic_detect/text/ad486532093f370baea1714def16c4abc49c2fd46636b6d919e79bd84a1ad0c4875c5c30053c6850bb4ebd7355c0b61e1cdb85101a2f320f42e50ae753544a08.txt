FRANK LAMPARD'S wife Christine watched on from the stands as the Chelsea boss set a horror unwanted record.

The Blues' 2-0 defeat to Real Madrid means Lampard has lost his first four games in charge since returning on an interim basis.

No manager in Chelsea's 118-year history has ever suffered such a bad start, so the former midfielder now has a place in the club record books for the wrong reason.

Christine was in attendance to watch her husband's side disappoint once again, with a Rodrygo double sealing Real Madrid's place in the Champions League semi-final.

She did her best to support Lampard and looked elegant wearing a black top and blazer paired with jeans.

The TV presenter has been a key supporter of Lampard's career and was frequently spotted in the stands during his playing days.

Lampard, 44, needs all the support he can get as he faces two tricky opponents in Brentford and Arsenal up next.

As well as Real, Chelsea have lost to Wolves and Brighton in Lamard's first four games and are now in danger of losing five on the bounce for the first time since 1993.

They have also failed to score in 18 games this season, their highest tally of goalless returns since 1980-81.

While Lampard has now lost 14 of his last 17 games as a manager, winning only once in a run that stretches back to his spell at Everton - where he was sacked in January.

Chelsea are now at risk of recording their worst league finish since 1993-94, when they placed 14th.

They are currently 11th but with games against Manchester City, Bournemouth and Newcastle to come, they could slip further down the Premier League table.
