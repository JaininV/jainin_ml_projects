Will Alia Bhatt play the love interest of JrNTR in 'WAR2'?

Will Alia Bhatt play the love interest of JrNTR in 'WAR2'?As per the strong word of mouth in Tollywood, Ram Charan’s 'RRR' co-star, Alia Bhatt has been approached to play one of the female leads in JrNTR’s upcoming Bollywood multi-starrer film with Hrithik Roshan. The film is a sequel to 'WAR' and is said to be titled ‘WAR2’, which will be directed by 'Brahmastra' famed Ayan Mukherji.

There are also reports making rounds that Hrithik Roshan will be playing the lead role while JrNTR will be playing the antagonist in this Yash Raj’s spy universe film and B-Town diva Deepika Padukone will be reportedly romance Hrithik Roshan in the movie. And if things fall in proper place, Alia Bhatt will be paired with JrNTR in the film.

However, since casting isn't final yet, the question that remains unanswered is that if Alia is locked in, will she end up playing the love interest of Jr. NTR? Going by the earlier reports, JrNTR and Alia were supposed to act together in NTR30 but due to the 'Gangubai Kathiawadi' actress' busy schedule and Korala’s film getting delayed lead Jahnvi Kapoor landing in the project as the leading lady.

In the meanwhile, JrNTR is currently busy shooting for #NTR30 which he has confirmed by posting a glimpse from his sets. While ‘Viduthalai’ Part -1 director Vetrimaaran recently revealed that he is in talks with JrNTR for a gigantic massy film.
