As he’s said again this week, Vic Reeves has pretty much retired now, as he has no particular interest in doing comedy on telly or stage again, and he’s happy enough concentrating on his myriad other interests, most obviously his art, and if we see him on TV now it’ll more or less always be as Jim Moir. But he’s happy to do the odd show if it’s on something he’s passionate about, and that’s the case with his new series on this channel tonight where he and his wife Nancy head off birdwatching and paint what they find, a show bound to be compared to his mate Bob’s exploits on the river but seemingly just as entertaining and endearing. Then after that is this one-off in which Jim explores the links between comedy and art, joined by fellow arty comics including Bec Hill, Simon Munnery and Spencer Jones to discuss what the two media have in common and create some suitably amusing art while they do it.
