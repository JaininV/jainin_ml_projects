LITTLE CURRENT—With the advent of plastic grocery bags being banned, Orr’s Valu-Mart proprietor Andrew Orr discovered yet another opportunity to give back to the community.

“I came across these really sturdy bags that we could sell for $2, with 100 percent of the proceeds going directly to the Manor,” said Mr. Orr, noting that Manitoulin Centennial Manor’s fundraising efforts are a worthy cause. “I figure I will be moving in there myself down the road,” he quipped. “So, we want the Manor to be in great shape.”

The new bags feature the Manitoulin Swing Bridge on one side and sponsors logos on the other. “Our goal is 5,000. I ordered 2,500 with the swing bridge on them. When those are gone I will be ordering another 2,500 with the logo of the Island.”

“We really want to thank our sponsors, as well,” said Mr. Orr, noting the 10 sponsors of the bags are all readily recognizable Island businesses including mortgage specialist Kelly Ranta, Bousquet Realty, Manitoulin Eavestrough Inc., ACME Motors, Mike Phillips MPC Construction, DH Electrical, Manitoulin Storage, The Rain Barrel, Elliott’s Restaurant and Manitoulin Trout Farms.

“It’s important to give back to the community,” said Mr. Orr, whose Little Current business often hosts local charities and community service organizations in their fundraising efforts. “We are proud to do our part.”
