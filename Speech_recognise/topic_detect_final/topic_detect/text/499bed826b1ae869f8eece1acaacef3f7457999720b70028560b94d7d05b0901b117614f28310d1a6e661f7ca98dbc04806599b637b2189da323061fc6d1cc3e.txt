The Cayenne is Porsche’s largest offering at the moment, and more specifically wears a mid-size SUV body shape. It’ll come in standard and coupe (fastback-roofed) body styles.  It shares segment space with the BMW X5, Mercedes-Benz GLE-Class, Land Rover Range Rover Sport, Jaguar F-Pace, Audi Q8, and the Genesis GV80. Secondary competitors, depending who you ask, include the Acura MDX, Lexus RX, Lincoln Aviator, and, hear me out, the 2024 Mazda CX-90’s top-trim Signature inline-six.   What’s new on the outside?  Porsche’s Matrix LED Headlights are now standard, and HD Matrix LED Headlights are a new option. With two high-definition modules and over 32,000 pixels per headlamp, those optional units can pick out other oncoming road-users and block out some rays of light from the Cayenne’s high-beams, so as to not blind them. The brightness is regulated in more than 1,000 steps, depending on the driving situation. A revised front end and hood, new rear apron, and three-dimensionally designed taillights round out the exterior.

What’s new on the inside?  Screens, screens, screens. More specifically, a 12.6-inch “curved” instrument cluster, a 12.3-inch infotainment screen, and an optional 10.9-inch front-passenger screen to mostly mirror the primary one. There’s also a cabin air-quality system for 2024.   What’s new for the drive experience?  Well, there’s improved shock absorbers, enhanced adaptive air suspension, plus increased comfort at slower speeds. We’ll be able to give you much more detail in our exclusive first-drive video in the coming weeks.    Canada will see four engine options. You enter the Cayenne lineup via a 3.0L six-cylinder engine, producing 348 horsepower and 368 lb-ft of torque. Above that sits the Cayenne S, which gets the exciting mill for 2024: it runs on a much-revised 4.0L V8 bi-turbo engine putting out 468 horsepower and 442 lb-ft of torque. These numbers are up by 34 horsepower and 37 lb-ft of torque from the 2023 model’s also-twin-turbo V6.

The top-of-the-line available-only-in-the-coupe Turbo GT trim gallops using a 4.0L V8, tuned to make 650 roaring horsepower, and does the zero-to-100-km/h sprint in 3.3 seconds, faster than the upcoming 2024 BMW XM Red Label EV, which does it in 3.7 seconds. There’s no replacement for displacement here.         Speaking of electrification, the Cayenne E-Hybrid pairs that above-mentioned entry-level Porsche 3.0L six-cylinder engine with an electric motor to churn out a combined 468 horsepower 479 lb-ft of torque. The biggest change is the battery has been boosted from 17.9 kWh to 25.9 kWh. The global Porsche press release puts WLTP-testing battery-range figures in the up-to-90-km-of-all-electric-range zone. As of the time of publishing, however, Transport Canada hasn’t released its official figures. But if it’s close to 90 km, this’ll be a game-changer in the segment.

Why does it matter?  Having set its best-sales record in 2022 following a global increase in sales of three per cent (a massive figure for the niche luxury brand) and being, y’know, an SUV, the Cayenne is Porsche’s overall best seller. Also important: giving it up to three in-cabin screens (instrument cluster, infotainment, and an optional front-passenger screen) aligns with what’s happening in the modern luxury segment.   We’ll balance that by saying keeping the recognizable design lines while finessing the driver experience should keep the Cayenne atop the Porsche sales charts. And selling high volumes of this and the smaller Macan SUV means Porsche can allocate more funds to developing its two-door offerings, both present and future.

What does it cost and when can I get one?  The base 2024 Porsche Cayenne starts at $89,800 (with the Coupé variant starting from $95,400). The Cayenne E-Hybrid starts at $104,800 (the Coupé from $109,400). And the Cayenne S starts at $107,500 (the Coupé from $114,600). Want to beat that aforementioned XM’s zero-to-100-km/h time? The top-shelf Cayenne Turbo GT (Coupé style only) starts at $218,300.  The all-new 2024 Porsche Cayenne can be ordered now, with key fobs being exchanged mid-summer.
