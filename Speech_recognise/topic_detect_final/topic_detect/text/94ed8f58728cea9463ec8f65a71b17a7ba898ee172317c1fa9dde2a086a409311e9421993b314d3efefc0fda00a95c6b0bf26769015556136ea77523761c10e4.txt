The Macau Trade and Investment Promotion Institute (IPIM) has reported that the total number of participants in MICE events in Macau reached 200,000 in the first quarter of 2023, including over 15,000 business visitors who travelled to Macau for meetings.

IPIM has also predicted that more than 20,000 business visitors will attend MICE events in the SAR during the second half of the year.

With over 240,000 square meters of exhibition space and 40,000 hotel rooms, Macau is well-equipped to host conferences and exhibitions of various sizes and types, IPIM stressed in a statement.

MICE events have gradually been returning to Macau after the removal of Covid-related restrictions, and local authorities aim to host at least 700 such events in 2023 â€“ half of the pre-Covid level.

In 2022, Macau hosted 460 MICE events, and the total number of participants increased by 1.4 per cent year-on-year to 1,421,000.

Last year, exhibition organisers received MOP78.72 million (USD9.76 million) and spent MOP199 million, up by 2.7 per cent and 15.9 per cent year-on-year.

In the first quarter of 2023, Macau took in a total of 4.96 million visitors, with the highest daily visitor arrivals of the year exceeding 98,000 last Saturday.
