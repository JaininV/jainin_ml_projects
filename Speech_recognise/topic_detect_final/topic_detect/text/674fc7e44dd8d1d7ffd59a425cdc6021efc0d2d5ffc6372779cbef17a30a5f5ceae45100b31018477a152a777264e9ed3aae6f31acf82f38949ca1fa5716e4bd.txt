CHELSEA hero Oscar hinted he is open to return to the Premier League just six years after his departure.

The playmaker spent five successful years at Stamford Bridge where he won two Premier League titles as well as the Europa League and League Cup.

However, the ex-Brazil international made the bold decision to try his luck in China when he was only 26 years old and joined Shanghai Port.

The 31-year-old still plays in the Chinese Super League and is loving life in Asia.

So much so that the Brazilian is not eager to come back to Europe any time soon.

However, the ex-Internacional star admits a return to the Premier League would be "really cool."

Oscar told Premier League Brasil when asked if he still has a dream of returning to Europe: “I don't think so.

"As I played for Chelsea for five years, I fulfilled my dream of playing for a big club in Europe. But if you paint something in a cool team, of course, we can think about it.

“The Premier League is my favourite league. It's where I played, where I adapt very well, there's a game similar to mine, a dynamic and very fast game, so it was a league that I really enjoyed playing.

"If I could go back to the Premier League, that would be really cool. I also like Italy, I have an Italian passport.”
