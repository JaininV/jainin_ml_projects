As times change and gender roles evolve, the expectations placed on working dads have also changed.

Gone are the days when fathers were expected to be solely breadwinners while leaving the caregiving responsibilities to mothers.

Today, many working dads would like to be and are actively involved in parenting and strive to achieve a healthy work-life balance.

However, some outdated beliefs and misconceptions still linger, and it’s time to challenge and discard them.

Recently, during one of my Ask Dr. Alex sessions, I had a conversation with Peter (name has been changed for anonymity; this was published with his agreement), who was struggling with inappropriate comments from his colleagues at work.

Peter had made the decision to reduce his work contract to 50% so he could spend more time with his newborn baby.

However, instead of receiving support and understanding, he was met with ridicule and judgment from his colleagues.

Peter’s question was, “How can I stop my colleagues from making inappropriate comments just because I reduced my work contract to 50% in order to spend time with my baby?”

This is a prime example of an outdated belief that working dads don’t need to adhere to anymore.

The idea that men should prioritize work over family and not take on caregiving responsibilities is a remnant of the past.

In today’s society, it’s important to challenge and debunk these harmful ideas.

First and foremost, it’s crucial to understand that caregiving is not exclusive to one of the two parents.

Fathers have just as much right to be involved in their children’s lives and to prioritize their family alongside their work.

Men should not be shamed or ridiculed for choosing to reduce their work hours or take on flexible work arrangements to spend time with their children.

In fact, studies have shown that involved fathers have a positive impact on their children’s development and well-being.

Secondly, inappropriate comments or judgment from colleagues or anyone else for that matter are not acceptable.

It’s essential to set boundaries and address such behavior assertively. Peter should not have to tolerate disrespectful comments about his decision to prioritize his family.

So I talked him through this fabulous technique of how to give feedback in such a way that you mark your boundaries, but without offending the other person.

It is important to communicate boundaries clearly, letting his colleagues know that their comments are unwelcome and unacceptable.

It’s also important for working dads to seek support from their partners, family, friends, and employers.

Building a strong support system can help alleviate the pressure and challenges that may arise when balancing work and family responsibilities.

Employers should also promote flexible work arrangements, parental leave policies, and a supportive work culture that recognizes and values the role of fathers in caregiving.

Let’s all make an effort to acknowledge that working dads no longer need to conform to past wisdoms that prioritize work over family.

It’s time to challenge and discard these outdated beliefs.

Men have the right to be actively involved in their children’s lives and prioritize their family alongside their career without facing judgment or ridicule.

Let’s break the mold and embrace a new era of working dads who are empowered to be loving, caring, and involved fathers.
