The financial crisis at UK Athletics is so severe that key coaches have not been paid in months.

Mail Sport understands some leading support personnel to podium-level athletes have been waiting since December for payments.

It follows our exclusive report last week that the cash-strapped governing body could cut as many as 10 members of non-performance staff in a desperate fight for their financial survival.

A consultation period will end on April 28, but the prognosis is grim on the back of dire financial figures released in December, in which UKA returned a massive £1.8million deficit for 2021-22 with savings plummeting from £2.2m to just £430,000.

A UKA spokesperson said: ‘Whilst we do not comment on individual cases UKA is currently in the process of putting new agreements in place to support a number of coaches through until Paris 2024.’

There have been a number of fears within the sport that the Diamond League meet at London Stadium in July could be affected, with no foreign stars yet announced.

However, sources have indicated that ticket sales in excess of 33,000 mean they can cover the £900,000 overheads of prize money, travel and appearance fees, and that half a dozen big names from abroad will shortly be confirmed.
