Dubbed "military reconnaissance satellite No. 1," the satellite is set to launch sometime in April, though no specific date was announced, state media KCNA reported.

Pyongyang in 2016 put another observation satellite into space, and it also appeared to tumble in space before stabilizing, the US said. The North claimed that itÂ received hundreds of images from the satellite.

It's not clear how useful this new spy satellite will be to Pyongyang. North Korea published photos in December that it said were taken from a mock test of the satellite, showing black-and-white, low-resolution images of Seoul.
