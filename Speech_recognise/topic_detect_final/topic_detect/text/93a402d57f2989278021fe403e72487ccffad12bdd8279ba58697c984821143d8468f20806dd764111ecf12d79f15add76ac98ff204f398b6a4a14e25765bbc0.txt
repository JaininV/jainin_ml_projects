GOOD Morning Britain was hit by a show spook today as a technical blunder took hold.

ITV hosts Susanna Reid, 52, and Martin Lewis, 50, were speaking to cyber security expert Lindy Cameron via a live link to Belfast.

The chat had been timed to coincide with CyberUK's annual conference, which today kicks off in the Northern Ireland city.

Yet after money saving expert Martin introduced the segment talking about "the threat from Russia" which he described as "far wider than just hacking" things started to go wrong.

He asked the expert: "What can you do to protect us?"

Yet with her face frozen on-screen and no audio she was unable to reply.

Susanna quipped: "Ooh! Has somebody interfered with the line?

"With the chief executive of the national cyber security centre who was about to talk about online disruption?"

Martin then interjected: "Hold on, I've just fixed it.

"I think she's back," to which Susanna replied: "Have we got Lindy?"

As the technology appeared to fail them again, she added: "Oh my gosh that's so spooky!

"Right we will talk to Lindy Cameron and we are determined to get answers about scams and how we can help you."

The interview came after Martin signed on as a permanent GMB host.

He now joins the weekday breakfast programme on Wednesdays across the year alongside the show's long-term presenter Susanna.

Speaking about his new role, Martin said: "To have the ability to hold politicians to account over the cost of living is a privilege and a responsibility.

"It's a slight gear change from my usual work, but after years of answering complex questions, it's nice for once to be asking them.

"So I was delighted when ITV offered me the role of regular presenter."
