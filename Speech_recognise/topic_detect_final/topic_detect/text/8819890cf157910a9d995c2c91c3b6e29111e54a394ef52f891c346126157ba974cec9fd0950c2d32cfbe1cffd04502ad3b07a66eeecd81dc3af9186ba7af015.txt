According to a report on The Express, Chelsea appointing Luis Enrique as permanent manager will help the Blues sign 18 year old Barcelona star Gavi.

Enrique has placed his trust in the young midfielder at international level over the last couple of seasons and his presence at Stamford Bridge would serve as an extra incentive for Gavi to leave Barcelona and join Chelsea.

Gavi will become a free agent at the end of the season.

Enrique and former Bayern Munich boss Julian Nagelsmann are favourites for the permanent Chelsea job although reports from South America claim former River Plate boss Marcelo Gallardo is getting closer to getting the Chelsea job.
