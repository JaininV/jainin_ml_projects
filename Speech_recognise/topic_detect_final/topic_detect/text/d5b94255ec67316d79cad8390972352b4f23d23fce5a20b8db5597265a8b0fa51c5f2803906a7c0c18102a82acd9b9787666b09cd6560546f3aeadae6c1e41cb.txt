Since President Barack Obama entered the White House in 2009, the national debt has risen by around $20 trillion (“Ballooning National Debt Is a Rotten Legacy” by William Galston, Politics & Ideas, April 12). Can someone please show us what we got for that money? Our school systems are a joke, defense is underfunded and still politicians claim we are cutting to the bone if even a freeze on spending is proposed. As a former chief executive, I reviewed all expenses on a zero base. Politicians should do the same.
