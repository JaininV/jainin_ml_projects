Mumbai Indians' young batting sensation Tilak Varma has started IPL 2023 with a bang following a breakthrough season for the five-time champions last year. Following his decisive knock against the Delhi Capitals, former Indian head coach Ravi Shastri reckoned the youngster is not far away from getting his maiden national call-up.

Rohit Sharma's men, who were searching for their first victory in IPL 2023 during the clash against Delhi Capitals, got over the line in a nail-biting thriller. Tilak Varma, who was promoted up the batting order to tackle Delhi's spinners, played an excellent hand to bring his side to the cusp of victory.

Following his steady batting display, former Indian cricketer and head coach Ravi Shastri stated that the youngster already feels like a Team India player. The cricketer-turned-expert said he will be surprised if the youngster is not involved with the national side in the upcoming six or eight months.

"India player already. This guy is an Indian player and I would be very surprised if he does not play T20 cricket for India in the next six months or eight months. He has got the maturity, he has got the flare. He will make a world of difference to the Indian middle order," Ravi Shastri said while speaking on Star Sports.

The young batting ace smashed 41 runs off just 29 deliveries to turn the match in his side's favour in a hard-fought contest in Delhi. The former Indian cricketer feels that the 20-year-old batter is showing maturity beyond his years and looks ready to rub shoulders with the big boys which is a really good sign for Indian cricket.

"He is just 20 years of age, the kind of maturity he is showing, is someone who is much older than that. It is very positive, not only from the Mumbai point of view but from the India point of view as well," Shastri added.
