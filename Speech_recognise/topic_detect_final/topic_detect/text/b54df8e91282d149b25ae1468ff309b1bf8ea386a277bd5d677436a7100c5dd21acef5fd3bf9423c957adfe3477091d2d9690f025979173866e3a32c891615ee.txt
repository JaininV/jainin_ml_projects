The former Norwood Inn off Highway 169Â  in North Mankato will become an apartment and retail space.

Monday night the city council unanimously approved a conditional-use permit that would create a 120,000-square-foot development with 75 one-bedroom apartments, commercial, and retail space at the Range St and Webster St location.

The buyer is 1111 Holdings, owned by local developers Marty Walgenbach and Max DeMars. The developers also have purchase agreements for the nearby liquor store on Range St and a vacant lot between the hotel and the former Perkins.

The Norwood Inn is currently under lease to HyLife Foods, which has used the former hotel to house hundreds of workers from the Windom pork processing plant.
