Contrary to the many ‘Russian are stupid’ stereotypes that have developed throughout the war, they have demonstrated an ability in some areas to learn and adapt. This isn’t a statement of admiration. 1/25 🧵 pic.twitter.com/xw5x0kqO8s

7/ The disastrous crossing of the Severskii River was another exemplar of poor Russian tactical integration in their combat operations. It was indicative of an army that was still coming to grips with modern targeting, and complex tactical integration when crossing obstacles. pic.twitter.com/q9miLtsYei

9/ Other more recent tactical adaptations bear mentioning. The first that emerged was the large-scale deployment of Wagner Group mercenaries in 2022, particularly in the Bakhmut area of eastern Ukraine.

18/ Since then, the Russians have further developed these eastern and southern defensive belts. The twitter feed maintained by Brady Africk (@BradyAfr) is an excellent resource in following Russian construction of these obstacle belts and zones. pic.twitter.com/DlA12vePai

Do sada su Rusi pokazali sposobnost učenja i prilagodbe na taktičkoj razini. Ta je prilagodba bila neujednačena, nije bila vidljiva u čitavom nizu ruskih vojnih operacija, a mnoge ideje jedva da su nove. No, neporecivo je da je došlo do nekog učenja i evolucije. To je vojna sposobnost koja će biti osnova za stalnu sposobnost Rusije da provodi operacije u Ukrajini i ona koju bi trebalo proučiti zbog slabosti koje bi mogle iskoristiti ukrajinske snage kao i zapadne obavještajne agencije.
