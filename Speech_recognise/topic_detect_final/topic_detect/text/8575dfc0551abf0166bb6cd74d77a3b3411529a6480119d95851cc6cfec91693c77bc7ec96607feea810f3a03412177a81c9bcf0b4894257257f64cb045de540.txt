Chelsea and Real Madrid will go head-to-head in the second leg of their UEFA Champions League semi-final at Stamford Bridge. With the first leg ending in a 1–1 draw, the Blues have the upper hand as they have an away goal to their credit. Both teams come into the game after registering victories in their respective domestic leagues.

Real Madrid will have to play without their star defender Sergio Ramos, who is out due to injury, and will also be without their influential winger Lucas Vazquez. Chelsea, on the other hand, will have a fully fit squad to choose from and will be looking to exploit Real Madrid’s weakened defense.

The battle will be intense in the midfield, where N’Golo Kante and Jorginho will look to stifle Real Madrid’s creative players. On the other hand, Toni Kroos and Luka Modric will be instrumental in setting up Real Madrid’s attacks.

The game will also see a battle of the strikers, with Chelsea’s Timo Werner and Real Madrid’s Karim Benzema looking to get on the scoresheet. However, it will be the defenses that will have the final say, and whoever can keep a clean sheet will have a massive advantage going into the final.

The game promises to be a fascinating encounter between two of Europe’s biggest clubs, and with a place in the final at stake, both teams will be looking to give their all. Fans can catch all the action live on TV or stream the game online.
