Vancouver-based North South Travel advisor Angela Wright is packing her bags for Ireland as the winner of CIE Tours’ “90 Shades of Green” sweepstake

CIE Tours launched the sweepstakes in celebration of its 90th anniversary exclusively for travel advisors in North America.

As a sign of appreciation for travel advisor partners in the U. S. and Canada, the sweepstakes offered a chance to win a free trip for two to Ireland. To enter, travel advisors were invited to answer multiple choice questions about Ireland over the course of four weeks.

Jennifer Bond, CIE Tours business development manager for Canada, said: “We are delighted to introduce Angela to Ireland’s charm and warm hospitality. CIE Tours places great value on our travel advisor partnerships, and we look forward to growing these relationships even more throughout Canada.”

Wright was randomly selected from more than 7,000 entries to win the seven-day “Taste of Ireland” trip for two. Beginning and ending in Dublin, the tour visits Ireland’s most iconic attractions including Blarney Castle, the majestic Cliffs of Moher, a drive along the picturesque Ring of Kerry, a family-run sheepdog farm, and a visit to Galway, among other must-see Irish experiences.

Her first visit to Ireland, Wright said she looks forward to experiencing CIE Tours as a guest and to seeing how the operations work on tour. She added, “It’s much more authentic to present an idea to clients when I have firsthand experience to share.”

Wright started her luxury travel advisor business in 2019 and spent four years as an independent contractor before joining North South Travel in January 2023.
