Secretary-General of Hezbollah, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, affirmed that the return of sound political ties binding Syria and a number of Arab countries is an important matter, in addition to the recovery, security and stability in the country.

Sayyed Nasrallah said in a speech Friday on the occasion of International Quds Day, “We are witnessing the return of normal political relations with numerous Arab countries in recent days, and there are talks about opening consulates and Syria’s return to the Arab League”.

“Even on the Turkish issue, Turkey wants to meet, negotiate and visit, and the Syrian leadership is the side that is presenting natural conditions related to the occupation of the Syrian lands, and these transformations are important in Syria despite the suffering resulted from the so called “Cesar Act”, economic sanctions and the living situation, from which we all suffer.”

On the other hand, Sayyed Nasrallah stressed that the celebration of International Quds Day is a message of support for the Palestinian people and a message to the Zionist enemy that Palestine has not and will not be forgotten, and that al-Quds has not and will not be left, stressing that the West Bank is the shield of al-Quds with its steadfastness and resistance, and everyone must support it by all means.
