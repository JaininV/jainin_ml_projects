Trader Joe's puts a lot of effort into generating new hype-worthy products to add to its roster of iconic snacks and ready-to-eat foods, and TJ's fans are always dying to take a bite out of something new and unexpected. But not every new product from the cult favorite grocery store is a hit. Sometimes they flop â€” and they flop hard.

With new products especially, it's hard to know if you're buying your new favorite snack or something you'll toss in the garbage after two bites. TJ's already has a return policy that allows shoppers to return any item for a full refund, even if you've already opened it and you don't have a receipt.

But there is another workaround for trying products, a TJ's bylaw that gives customers who are in the know a leg up while shopping: the Trader Joe's "Try Anything" policy. You can sample almost any Trader Joe's product before buying. Store employees are encouraged to let you try ready-to-eat or drink items, like salads, chips, pepper-coated salami, or brewed ginger beer, to find out if they're actually worth the purchase.

But just how far does Trader Joe's "Try Anything" policy go?
