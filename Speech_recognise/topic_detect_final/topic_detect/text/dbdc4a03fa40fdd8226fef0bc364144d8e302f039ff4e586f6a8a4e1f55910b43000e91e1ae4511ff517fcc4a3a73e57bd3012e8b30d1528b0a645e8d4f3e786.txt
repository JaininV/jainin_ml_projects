This month I went with all of my favorite pieces, no surprises. I brought back a few pieces from my March capsule (the shorts, the anorak) and added in a few new pieces I’ve picked up over the last few weeks. This Abercrombie dress for one is a favorite. We have a Florida trip coming up and that will definitely in my bag. I added in this tee from my Essentials post, because it is after all an essential, and I tossed in my tried and true denim shorts. On the purses, I brought back this Clare V. Crossbody (a favorite from last summer!) and this J. Crew tote which will be on me from now until September 1st.

You can see all 16 pieces below!
