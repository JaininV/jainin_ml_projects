Brighton and Hove Albion right-back Joël Veltman may be out of contract this summer but a return to Ajax is seemingly not on the cards.

The Dutchman has been a key part of the Seagulls’ success this season, which has seen them make the FA Cup semis while also jostling for a record-high league finish and a European berth. He has made 22 Premier League starts to date, however, his time at the AMEX Stadium looks to coming to an end.

Returning to his former club would appear to make sense for myriad reasons, namely family and international chances, but it has been near-ruled out by the player.

In an interview with Voetbal International, Veltman said he was “having a good time in England, but Italy or Spain would also be nice. Returning to Ajax is not an option for me right now”.

The right-back spot has been an issue for the Amsterdam giants all season following the departure of Noussair Mazraoui to Bayern Munich last summer. Neither Devyne Rensch nor Jorge Sánchez have been able to nail down the spot due to injury and iffy form respectively, leading to links with both Veltman and fellow former Ajax player Kenny Tete, now of Fulham.

The 31-year-old Veltman alluded to this but said “there has never been any contact” with his old employers.

Veltman still holds the club close to his heart, which is unsurprising given he spent his entire career there prior to his move to Brighton in 2020. He added that he was happy for the club and new boss Johnny Heitinga that ‘they now have things back on track’ after the tumultuous reign of Alfred Schreuder.

For now, though, he will remain a fan of the club, as a second stint is not in the offing.
