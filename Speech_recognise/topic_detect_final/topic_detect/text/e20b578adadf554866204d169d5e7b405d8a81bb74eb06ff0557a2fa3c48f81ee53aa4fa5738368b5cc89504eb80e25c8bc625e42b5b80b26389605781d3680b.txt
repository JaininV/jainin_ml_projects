Sammy Green, travel blogger at My Blonde Bucket List, has traveled to Thailand several times on various budgets and recommends the country for overseas travel.

Green said Thailand’s size is a great travel benefit. “Because it is such a large country, there are a ton of accommodation options and this helps keep prices competitive,” Green said.

If you’re looking for a hotel to stay at, Green said you can score a lovely hotel at a cheap price, especially in the offseason or shoulder season. Many hotels run promotions during this time with as much as 50% off rates. Travelers looking for even cheaper lodgings may consider staying at some of the hostels in Thailand, many of which Green said offer rates of around $10 a night.

Would Thailand’s large size mean travelers would spend more money on transportation? Not at all.

“If you are heading out to one of the islands, such as Koh Samui, it’s possible to get a ferry instead of flying,” Green said. “For short travel to and from restaurants or beaches, it’s possible to catch a tuk tuk which is the local version of a taxi.

Meals are also reasonably priced in Thailand. Green said in the North she ate meals for about $1 daily.

“You do need to hunt out the local places if you want to eat that cheaply,” Green recommends. “In the South, it tends to be a little pricier because it’s more touristy but it is still incredibly cheap. You could expect to eat a nice meal for about $5 to $10.”

Sightseeing and experiences are also reasonably priced in Thailand and a lot of fun.

“Thailand has a pretty special culture and the people are wonderful. You can expect to come across a lot of beautiful temples and usually, you just have to pay a small entry fee to go inside,” Green said. “Bangkok is very popular for this and a famous temple worth visiting is Wat Pho.”
