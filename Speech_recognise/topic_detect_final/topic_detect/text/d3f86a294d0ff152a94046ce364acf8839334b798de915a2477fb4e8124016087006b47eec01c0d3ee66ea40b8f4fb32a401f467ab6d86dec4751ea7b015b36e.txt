Crystal Palace are now said to have a unique plan for Roy Hodgson next season as Steve Parish continues his hunt for a new manager.

The south Londoners opted to hand the reins over to the 75-year-old until the end of the season after sacking Patrick Vieira in March, and it has proven to be a wise decision.

Hodgson has won all three of his games in charge so far – now, he could be staying at Selhurst Park.

Well – according to the Telegraph – Crystal Palace want Hodgson to stay in SE25 for the 2023/24 campaign, but in an advisory role rather than the dugout.

It is said that the Eagles want the Croydon-born tactician to work alongside a younger manager who would eventually take full control of the team.

It would be the first time in his lengthy career that Hodgson – who has 128 Premier League wins to his name – has carried out such a role if he does agree to stay on and assist his replacement.

By the sounds of things, Vieira’s lack of experience may have caused issues at times, so Parish is keen to avoid any hiccups with his next appointment as he targets another young manager.

Crystal Palace certainly seem set on hiring a relatively young coach.

The Guardian believe Vincent Kompany and Michael Carrick are options to replace Hodgson this summer.

Elsewhere – according to The Times – Arne Slot of Feyenoord is another target for the south Londoners, with the Dutchman a leading candidate after guiding his Feyenoord side eight points clear of Ajax at the top of the Eredivisie.

Another story from the Guardian claimed that Adi Hütter and Paulo Fonseca are also on the shortlist.
