On the acting front, Shahroz Sabzwari played antagonist Shaheer Illahi in the super hit drama ‘Hook.’ His character was that of an arrogant man who was in one-sided love with a girl named Haya. Since Haya didn’t love him back, he planned to go to any lengths to get her.

It is pertinent to mention here that celebrity couple, Shahroz Sabzwari and Sadaf Kanwal welcomed their first child, daughter Syeda Zahra Sabzwari in August last year. The baby girl is first for Sadaf and second for Shahroz, who is father to Nooreh, with his ex-wife, actor Syra Yousuf.
