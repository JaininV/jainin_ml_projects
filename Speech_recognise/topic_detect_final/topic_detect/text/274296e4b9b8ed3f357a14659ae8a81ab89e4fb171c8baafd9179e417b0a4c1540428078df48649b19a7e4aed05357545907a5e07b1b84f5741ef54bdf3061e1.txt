Real Madrid’s Thibaut Courtois claims the Chelsea crowd were fully behind their side last night at Stamford Bridge.

Chelsea exited the Champions League competition last night at the quarter-finals stage, but the home fans did everything in their powers to try lift the players.

The Blues were losing 2-0 on aggregate from the first leg. Therefore, it was going to take something special in yesterday’s second leg in West London.

Despite creating a few glorious opportunities to score in the opening hour, Chelsea couldn’t find their way back into the tie. In fact, Rodrygo scored a second-half brace to give Madrid another 2-0 victory, which saw them coast into the semi-finals with a 4-0 aggregate triumph.

Courtois, 30, certainly played his role with a big performance in the Madrid net. The former Chelsea goalkeeper pulled off a couple of magnificent saves to deny the Blues, including a magnificent one from Marc Cucurella on the stroke of half-time.

Chelsea fans were clinging on to hope of one goal to get back into the tie, something which never quite materialised.

Courtois did comment on the home support in his post-match press conference:

“The match was intense for me and managing to win with a clean sheet is always a good thing. The first half wasn’t the best, but we corrected things at half-time. We improved in the second half and scored two important goals. They could’ve got back into the game, the fans were behind them. They were looking for that goal to bring them hope and fortunately Rodrygo scored,” Courtois said, as quoted by Real Madrid’s official website.

Unfortunately, the Blues yet again encountered the same issues of struggling to score goal.

Courtois, who received relentless booing from the Chelsea fans, proved to be impregnable over the two legs.
