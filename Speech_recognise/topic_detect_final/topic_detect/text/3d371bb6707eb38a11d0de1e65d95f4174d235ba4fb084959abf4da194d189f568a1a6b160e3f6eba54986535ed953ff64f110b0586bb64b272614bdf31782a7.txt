French company Zephalto plans to offer six-hour balloon flights to the stratosphere, which they hope to begin operating in 2025. The flights will cost €120,000 per person and reach an altitude of 25 km. Although not space tourism, passengers will view 98 percent of the Earth’s atmosphere below, space darkness above and see the planet’s curved horizon. Zephalto aims to make its mark with high-quality food, drinks and comfort, and each flight can accommodate six passengers and two pilots. The company is planning about 60 flights per year from a location in France, although market demand for the service is unclear.
