On St Eustatius, prices were up by 8.0 percent year on year in Q1 2023. In Q4 2022, the inflation rate stood at 9.1 percent. The subsidy on the fixed usage tariff for electricity had a dampening effect on inflation here as well.

The inflation on Saba amounted to 7.0 percent in Q1 2023. This was still 9.7 percent in Q4 2022. The downward effect was mainly caused by a drop in the variable usage tariff for electricity. In addition, petrol became cheaper.

Inflation is the year-on-year change in the consumer price index; it was lower on all three islands in the first quarter. The decline was strongest on Bonaire: from 8.1 percent in Q4 to 4.5 percent in Q1. On St Eustatius and Saba, the decrease was less substantial.

This does not mean that prices in the first quarter of 2023 also fell compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. Prices on Bonaire rose by 0.9 percent and on St Eustatius by 0.4 percent. Only Saba recorded a very slight price decrease: -0.1 percent in Q1 2023 relative to Q4 2022.

Relative to Q4 2022, prices on Bonaire rose by 0.9 percent in Q1 2023. This increase was mainly due to higher prices of food and non-alcoholic beverages.

Furthermore, the waste collection charge rose as of 1 January 2023.

Electricity was cheaper in Q1 due to the aforementioned subsidy on the fixed usage tariff. Furthermore, petrol and diesel decreased in price compared to the previous quarter, by 8.5 and 11.6 percent respectively.
