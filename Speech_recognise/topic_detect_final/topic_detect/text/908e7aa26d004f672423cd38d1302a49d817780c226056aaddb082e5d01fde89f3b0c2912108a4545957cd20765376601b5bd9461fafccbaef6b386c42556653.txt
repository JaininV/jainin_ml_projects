CUI Devices’ Interconnect Group has added USB 3.2 Gen 2×2 Type C models to its line of USB connectors. Offering high data transfer speeds of up to 20Gb per second, the UJ32 family of USB Type C connectors is a cost-effective option for designs that do not require the full capabilities of the USB4 40Gb per second standard.

The models also deliver power capabilities up to 100W with 20V voltage ratings and 5A current ratings for faster power charging.

With the EU set to make USB Type C the unified charger for mobile devices in 2024 and laptops in 2026, CUI Devices’ USB Type C connectors are aimed at keeping future designs in compliance.

Housed in surface mount or mid mount SMT packages with horizontal or vertical orientations, CUI Devices’ USB 3.2 Gen 2×2 Type C connectors feature gold flash contacts and operating temperature ranges from -40 degrees C to 85 degrees C. These USB Type C receptacles are reflow solder compatible with high reliability ratings up to 10,000 mating cycles. The UJ32-C-H-G-SMT-TR-68 also carries an IP68 rating for applications dealing with harsh environments.

The UJ32 models are available immediately with prices starting at $1.43 per unit at 250 pieces through distribution.

The UJ32 USB Type C connectors are aimed at consumer and portable electronics users.
