As part of a large end-of-year spending agreement, Congress passed a law that requires all Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)-registered practitioners to meet a one-time, eight-hour training requirement on the treatment and management of patients with opioid or other substance use disorders. The requirement takes effect on June 27, 2023.

What PAs Should Know About the Requirement

* “New” training will not necessarily be required; rather, as stated in the law and DEA notification to registered practitioners, previous and existing training provided by AAPA and other organizations can satisfy the requirement.

* Once the required training is completed, it never has to be repeated. It is a one-time training attestation that will not be a part of future registration renewal.

* Practitioners are not required to supply “proof” of training. They are required to check a box on their online DEA registration form when they renew their registration.

* Practitioners are not required to verify they have completed training until their registration is due for renewal.

* The required 8 hours of training does not have to be completed in one session; it can be multiple sessions that total eight hours.

* SAMHSA recommends that training content should be related to the prevention, recognition and care of people with substance use disorders including those with concurrent pain and/or psychiatric and medical co-morbidities.
