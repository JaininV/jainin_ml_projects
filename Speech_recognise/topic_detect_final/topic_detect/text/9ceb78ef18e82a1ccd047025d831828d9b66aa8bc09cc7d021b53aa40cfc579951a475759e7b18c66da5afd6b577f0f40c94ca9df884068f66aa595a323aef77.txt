Police confirm killing of two Immigration officers by bandits in Taraba State

The Taraba State Police Command has confirmed the killings of two Immigration officers in the state by unknown gunmen.

The killing of the officers is coming barely a day after the gruesome murder of staff of the Federal University, Wukari.

Confirming the attack on Wednesday, the state police command Public Relations Officer, (PPRO), Abdullahi Usman, said the officers were brutally matcheted by their killers.

The killings of the officers which according to the command were executed by suspected bandits, occurred yesterday along Takum/Ussa local government councils road.

Identifying the officers as Inspector Adike Austin and Uzo James, he said, “They were not only shot dead but there were also matcheted with cuts all over their bodies.”

Adding that the deceased officers are with the “Immigration Department attached to Ussa local government council checkpoint.”

While their remains have been deposited at the mortuary for autopsy, he said the state police command has commenced investigations with the hope of tracking down the perpetrators.

The command insisted that the killing is not related to the ongoing herders/ farmers crisis in the council that has led to the wanton destruction of lives and property.

Although the Immigration Service could not be reached at the time of this report for an official statement, some of its officers who spoke with our state correspondent, said the command received the news with shock.
