When Walt Disney started to initiate his plans to build Disneyland in California, he went to the city of Burbank, and they turned him down for his request for 7 acres of land, a ridiculously small space. The result was that he had to move south to find land, and he ended up having 150 acres for his park. Can you imagine what would have happened if his initial request had been accepted? The guess is that Disneyland would probably not be as renowned as it is today, and it would have been a far smaller project. The idea here is that an initial step back that may not even happen because of your lack of effort could work in a way that will be helpful for you. As long as you do not give up, every little failure will only act to help you become better at what you do.

The second part concerns whether you are ready to take a bigger step. Moving from the initial plan of 7 acres to the one that includes 150 acres of land requires commitment. Are you ready to be big? That is the next thing you should consider and see whether you are determined enough.

What would you do if you found moldy food inside your fridge? You would immediately throw it away in the trash bin, separate it from the good food and get rid of it. Well, the same thing happens with ”moldy” habits, beliefs, events, and generally, whatever brings toxicity to our lives. If you had a bad day, that does not define your week, let alone your year. Put that aside and focus on what is helpful. The moldy food is taken away because it stopped serving its purpose. It was initially there because we would benefit from that. Once it goes bad or we change and no longer need it, the food is simply working in the opposite direction. Instead of benefiting us, it takes the space that could be covered by something useful and perhaps essential.

You do not want to let challenging situations exist just because they do not bother you at the moment. Eventually, they will infect the rest of your reality. The sooner you get rid of them, the better for you. The metaphor of food could talk about many things that bring negativity to your life, and it should be considered as a golden rule to keep yourself safe and your life clean.
