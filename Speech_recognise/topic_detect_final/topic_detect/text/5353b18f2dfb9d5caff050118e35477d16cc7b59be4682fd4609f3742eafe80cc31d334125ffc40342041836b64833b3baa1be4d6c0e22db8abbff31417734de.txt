New features now available in GA include the ability to customize your compute instance with applications that do not come pre-bundled in your CI, create a compute instance for another user, and configure a compute instance to automatically stop if it is inactive.

Personalize your Compute Instance with Custom Applications : You can now work with enhanced customizability and greater integration with this new capability to personalize your compute instances.

Create on behalf of compute instances : You can now create a compute instance for another user, which will allow for greater say in the compute instanceâ€™s development, training, or inferencing needs.

Configure auto-stop for idle compute instances : You can now save on extraneous costs by ensuring that the compute instance is shutdown when inactive.
