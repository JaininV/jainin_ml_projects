Plenty of coronation parties are being thrown across London — but not many of them are on the Thames!

From 17 April to 8 May, City Cruises boats are breaking out the bunting for a special series of Coronation Cruises. Vessels will be getting into the spirit, decked out in coronation-themed décor, while allowing passengers to admire — and hop off to visit — London locations linked to the Royal Family.

On sightseeing tours — or with a 24 -hour hop-on, hop-off River Pass — passengers can cruise past royal landmarks, such as the Tower of London (from which many monarchs ruled over many centuries), and St Paul's Cathedral (where Charles married Diana in 1981). You can also use City Cruises to explore royal institutions; hop off at Westminster Millennium Pier to see Westminster Abbey*, setting for the new King's coronation. Westminster Millennium Pier is also where you should alight for a walk through St James's Park, to Buckingham Palace, birthplace — and now home — of Charles III.

Lunch, afternoon tea, and dinner cruises, meanwhile, will serve up Royally-themed menus (think crown-shape sweet treats, pink fizz and coronation chicken sandwiches).

As usual, all City Cruises come with informative and entertaining onboard commentary — feeding you titbits of Londony (and regal) trivia, along the way. Bringing little 'uns aboard? Fun activities are provided, so the whole family's happy.

Prefer to let your hair down, and celebrate in an altogether wilder way? The Thamesjet Speedboat ride is the experience for you. On this high-octane, adrenaline-pumping river tour, you'll whizz by the iconic likes of Tower Bridge, Big Ben, the London Eye and the Tower of London — all in just 50 minutes. For a thrilling time out on the river, full of twists and turns, it can't be beaten.

Celebrate Charles' crowning in unique style with a special Coronation Cruise, or do things your own way, with a Thamesjet Speedboat ride.
