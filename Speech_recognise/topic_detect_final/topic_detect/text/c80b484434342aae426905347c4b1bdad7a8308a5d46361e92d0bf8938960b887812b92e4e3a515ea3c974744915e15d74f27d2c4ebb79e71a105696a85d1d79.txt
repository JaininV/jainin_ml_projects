Emmerdale executive producer Jane Hudson has hinted that a new romance is on the cards for Liam Cavanagh.

Speaking to Digital Spy and other press about the upcoming storyline, Hudson said: "We've got a more light-hearted story with Liam - our Dr Cavanagh, or should we be saying Dr Love?

"There's going to be something that I think will take you all by surprise and it starts off as quite a fun story but at the heart of it there is something serious, which will come out further down the line."

Hudson added: "But it's a great story. We'll see Liam and another character in a way we've perhaps not seen them before, so I can't wait for you to watch that."

Liam's love life has been anything but smooth in recent months, given he split from his wife Leyla Cavanagh towards the end of last year, after cheating on her with his ex-fiancé Bernice Blackstock.

Liam ended up locking lips with Bernice once again over Christmas, though she was left horrified after Liam vomited on her shoes.

It sounds like things are looking Liam up for Liam though, and he's not the only singleton gearing up for a summer romance.

Hudson recently revealed that Belle Dingle will find a new love interest in Jimmy King's nephew Tom,  who returns to the village after a 10-year absence next week.

"Of course Tom and Belle have a history, which – when they see each other – they rekindle," she said. "We will be on a journey with Tom and Belle for quite some time as we play out the story."

Emmerdale airs on weeknights at 7.30pm on ITV1, and streams on ITVX.
