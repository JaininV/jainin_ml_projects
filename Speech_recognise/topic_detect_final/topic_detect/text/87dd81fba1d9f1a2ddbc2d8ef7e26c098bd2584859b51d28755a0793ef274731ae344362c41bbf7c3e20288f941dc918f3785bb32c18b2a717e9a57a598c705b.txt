Carlo Ancelotti, before starting the last training session before Chelsea-Real Madrid, gave a talk to his players and gave them some advice for the match. The Italian called for "attitude" and "commitment" at its best.

Madrid have a great opportunity to reach the semi-finals of the Champions League. On Tuesday, Real Madrid visit Stamford Bridge to face Chelsea, who have to turn around the 2-0 first leg deficit at the Santiago Bernabeu.

Ancelotti is wary of the Londoners and in the last training session before the game, the Italian gave a talk to try to get his players to understand what he wants for the game.

"We have to play a complete game. We're in good shape. We have to show desire, commitment and attitude like we had in Wednesday's game (first leg with Chelsea) and also on Saturday's game (Cadiz). Attitude and courage at the back for the defence in every game," said the Italian.

Everything suggests that the coach will field the same team that won the first game against the Blues at the Santiago Bernabeu. Vinicius and Kroos were present at training and will be back after resting against Cadiz.
