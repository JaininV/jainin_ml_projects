The US Ambassador to Russia, Lynn Tracy, has strongly protested over provocative statements of “support” for Vladimir Kara-Murza* convicted of treason (recognized as a foreign agent in the Russian Federation). Earlier, Tracy had been summoned to Smolenskaya Square.

“It is emphasized that such actions, publicly committed with the aim of exerting pressure on the authorities and the judiciary, constitute gross interference in the internal affairs of the Russian Federation,” the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.

Ambassador Tracy was also singled out for the hypocritical and ridiculous attempts to shield the Washington-supervised “agent of influence” in the context of the brazen crackdown on dissent in the United States itself.

Any attempt by the US side to stir up discord and enmity in Russian society will be severely suppressed, the Russian Foreign Ministry noted. As for diplomats who violate the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and abuse their status, they will be forced to end their work in Moscow earlier than expected, the Russian Foreign Ministry said.

Previously, US, Canadian and British ambassadors Lynn Tracy, Alison Leclerc and Deborah Bronnet were summoned to the Russian Foreign Ministry. The day before, they attended the announcement of the sentence of Kara-Murza*. Official Moscow called it gross interference in the affairs of the country.
