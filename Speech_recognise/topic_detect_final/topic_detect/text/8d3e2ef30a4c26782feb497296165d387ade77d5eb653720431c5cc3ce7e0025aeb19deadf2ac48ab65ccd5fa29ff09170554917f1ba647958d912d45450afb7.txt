Earlier this week, the FDA recalled SimplyProtein Peanut Butter Chocolate Crispy Bars for "undeclared" cashews. In other words, there could be cashews in the bars, and the packaging neglected to say so. The product is made by Costco brand Wellness Natural U. S.A. Inc. and was only distributed to Costco stores in the U.S. The recalled item is part of a 15-bar variety pack with the flavors Lemon Coconut and Dark Chocolate Sea Salt. The other two flavors list potential cashew content on their wrappers, but the Peanut Butter Chocolate flavor doesn't.

This mislabeling might not just affect foodies who know they have a specific allergy to cashews. People allergic to almonds, walnuts, and other tree nuts might also be adversely affected by consuming cashews, according to Healthline. Additionally, cross-contamination between peanuts and cashews is unfortunately a possibility in food processing plants and can even instigate underlying allergies.

Thankfully, nobody has reported any injury or harm from the SimplyProtein mislabeling. In fact, the bars were voluntarily recalled in the first place because one customer called Wellness Natural U. S.A. Inc. with a complaint. The FDA did not specify whether this caller suffered an allergic reaction or not, but at least so far, no other consumers have come forward with any afflictions. Still, to be safe, here's what susceptible shoppers should look for.
