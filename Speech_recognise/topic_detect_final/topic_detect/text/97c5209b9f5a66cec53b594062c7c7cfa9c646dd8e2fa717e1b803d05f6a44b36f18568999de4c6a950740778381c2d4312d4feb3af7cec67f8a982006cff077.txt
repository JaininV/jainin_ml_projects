Reliance Jio has some big plans for JioCinema with plans of offering it as a subscription-based streaming platform. JioCinema is currently available for free to all Jio users, and it’s also where the popular Indian Premier League (IPL) is streamed live, after the much-popular FIFA World Cup, which was also free.

A new report now suggests that JioCinema’s revamp will actually be a merger with Viacom 18’s Voot, collectively making it ‘JioVoot’.

JioVoot is said to be the rebranded streaming platform, and its subscription plans will start at Rs 99, according to a report by OnlyTech. These details were fetched from the source code of the current JioCinema APK which revealed the new JioVoot name and also the subscription price.

This is supposedly the JioVoot Super Plan which is priced at Rs 99 but there’s no confirmation on whether this will be monthly or quarterly.

This comes after Reliance’s media and content business President Jyoti Deshpande confirmed in an interview with Bloomberg that JioCinema will indeed expand its base and start charging for content.

JioCinema may soon have a new name as the company plans to bring several new content onto its platform. This could be done to give the OTT platform a new identity apart from just an IPL streaming platform.

Currently, the platform is streaming Indian Premier League (IPL 2023) for free which has given a major boost to its viewership already.

It now seems that JioCinema may rebrand itself to JioVoot. In case you don’t know, Voot is another OTT platform that is owned by Viacom 18. The report comes from a community post on OnlyTech.

The post also reveals the starting price of the company’s first subscription plan for its OTT platform. Here’s everything you need to know about it.

Voot already exists as a streaming service and offers premium content starting at Rs 299 per year. For those unaware, Voot is a Viacom18 product which is under Network 18 that is a Reliance Industries subsidiary.

The one doubt and question looming over Jio users amid all these reports is whether IPL streaming would continue to be free or not. According to Reliance’s media and content business President Jyoti Deshpande, IPL will continue to be free even after the new subscription-based content plan. Deshpande confirmed this in a recent interview with Bloomberg where she shared the future plans for JioCinema.

There will be more than 100 movies and TV series added to JioCinema, and the new content will be available to watch before the end of IPL which is on May 28th. The company is also keeping in mind the price factor given the price-conscious market that India is, and also if it wants to compete with other streaming platforms.

But the company doesn’t plan to make JioCinema another platform for watching international content. It instead wants JioCinema to “get as Indian as it can.”

With IPL ending next month, we should get more clarity on Jio’s new content streaming plans and how it will compete with rivals in the market.

JioCinema is expected to go under a complete makeover after IPL 2023 ends. A post done by xcap6456 from Onlytech revealed that JioVoot could be the new name for JioCinema. The member deconstructed the current JioCinema APK and found some interesting details during his research.

In the screenshot above, the source code of the app reveals that JioVoot will be the new platform from Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance. It will be owned by Viacom 18 which also holds the digital rights for IPL 2023.

Reliance’s media and content business President Jyoti Deshpande in an interview revealed that major changes and new content are coming to JioCinema. It now seems that a name rebranding could be on the cards.

In our previous report ,we revealed that JioCinema could soon have a subscription-based model after IPL 2023. Deshpande also confirmed the same in the interview. She revealed that all the new content will come at a cost for consumers however, the company is still finalising the pricing strategy.

The deconstruction of JioCinema APK reveals that JioVoot will have a plan called Super Plan that could be priced at Rs 99 for users. As of now, it is hard to say whether it’s a monthly or annual fee. It is also unknown whether Jio users will get the content for free or on a paid basis.

This includes “Dunki,” starring Shah Rukh Khan, a courtroom drama for Amitabh Bachchan, as well as the “Bhediya” and “Stree” sequels.
