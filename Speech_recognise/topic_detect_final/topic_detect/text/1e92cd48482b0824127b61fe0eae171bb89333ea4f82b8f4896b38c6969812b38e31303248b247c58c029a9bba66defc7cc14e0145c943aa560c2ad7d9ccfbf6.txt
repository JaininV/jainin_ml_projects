During an interview with TMZ Sports, former WCW World Heavyweight Champion Diamond Dallas Page was asked his thoughts on Cody Rhodes losing to Roman Reigns in the main event of WrestleMania 39.

DDP, who is close to Cody, thinks The American Nightmare will eventually defeat The Tribal Chief to become the Undisputed WWE Universal Champion.

Below is what he said:

“Eventually, it’s gonna happen. And it’s because, now the fans, I mean, one of the things that happen in wrestling where, you know, sometimes the person will get pushed to the people. Now, they’re pushing – the people – because they want to see it. You know, though, it’s gonna take time.

Roman Reigns is one of the greatest champions of all time. I mean, he really is. And on top of being one of the most handsome guys alive. He’s got it all, the look, the size, the Bloodline, the whole thing is so strong.”

On this day in 1994, the World Wrestling Federation aired another episode of their weekly TV show ‘WWF Monday Night RAW’.

It was broadcasted from the Memorial Auditorium in Utica, New York and featured matches, interviews & storyline segments on the road to the ‘WWF King of the Ring 1994’ PPV.
