Bridgeport, Conn. – (April 18, 2023) – Even though the Fordham baseball team began an eight-game road trip on Tuesday, it felt like a home game for some of the Rams and they played to the crowd.  Fordham’s Connecticut-based trio of Daniel Bucciero, Chris Genaro, and Connor Haywood all played big parts in the Rams’ 9-7 win over Sacred Heart at Veteran’s Park in Bridgeport, Connecticut.
