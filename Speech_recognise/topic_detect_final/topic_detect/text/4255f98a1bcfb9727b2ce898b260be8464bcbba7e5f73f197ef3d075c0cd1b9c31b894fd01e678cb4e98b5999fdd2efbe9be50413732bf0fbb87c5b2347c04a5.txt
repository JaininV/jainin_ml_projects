Because of his past, Assistant District Attorney Paul Derohannesian reports the Ulster County DA’s Office “will file an application before Ulster County Court Judge Bryan Rounds for the defendant to be sentenced as a persistent felony offender to prevent him from doing any further harm to the people and businesses of Ulster County.”

"He has had numerous opportunities in the last 25 years or more to change his ways, including having a serious violent felony reduced to a misdemeanor in 2019, yet he has not shown any sign or inclination to change," the Ulster County DA's Office stated.

Persistent felony offender treatment is permitted by law to protect the community from criminals such as this defendant.
