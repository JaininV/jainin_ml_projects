• Over 38,400 schoolchildren deprived of education due to violence against school facilities

In March, the security situation remained relatively calm in some parts of the region. However, several areas, including Ouattagouna (Ansongo circle) and Gabero (Gao circle) experienced attacks by unidentified armed men that disrupted the local economy including the weekly markets when populations gather to exchange vital goods and services.

In March, security officials reported 51 security incidents compared to 11 in February.

Unidentified armed men perpetrated 19 of these incidents that were mainly armed robberies on major road axes such as the Ansongo-Menaka segment or attacks against civilian properties. On 30 March, a group of armed men attacked a gaz merchant’s house in Gao town. Increasing insecurity is disrupting the local economy in already fragile areas affected by poor supply of essential goods. Furthermore, the localities around the Gao-Ansongo-Labbezanga are exposed to frequent incursions of unidentified armed men, looting cattle and perpetrating human rights violations, particularly in hard-to-reach areas.
