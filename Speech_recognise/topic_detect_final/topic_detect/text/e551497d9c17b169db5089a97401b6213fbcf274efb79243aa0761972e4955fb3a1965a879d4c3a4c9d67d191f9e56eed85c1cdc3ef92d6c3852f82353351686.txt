April 18 – Brazilian wholesaler Assaí Atacadista has extended its title sponsorship of Campeonato Brasileiro Série A for a further season.

Assai began its title sponsorship with the 2018 season before renewing for another season in 2019 and for a further three season in 2020. The current extension will run until the end of the 2023 season.

As well as the naming rights to the league, the company has perimeter branding at club grounds as well as appearing in official league content.

Prior to Assai, the league has a title sponsorship with car manufacturer Chevrolet, which ended its deal in 2016.

No value was given for the Assai renewal.

In January Betano closed a new agreement for the naming rights to Brazil’s second tier Série B.  The division is now known as Série B Betano 2023.
