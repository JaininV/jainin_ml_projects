*  Didier Drogba criticizes Chelsea for having NO “class”.

Didier Drogba, a legend of Chelsea, has criticized his old team for lacking “class” following a tUrbUlent season that was essentially conclUded with a meek Champions League elimination.

Tuesday night's 2-0 defeat by Real MADrid against the Blues gave the current European Champions a comfortable 4-0 series victory. Chelsea, has little left to play for after already losing in the semifinals of the domestic cup tournaments and currently occupying the 11th spot in the Premier League

When Drogba was commentating on Tuesday's game for the French network Canal+, the Ivorian ackNOwledged that he thought the team had regressed under the new management.

“I knew this club with a certain class during the [roman] Abramovich era, but today I find it lacking,” Drogba said.

“It's very hard for me to see how they got rid of certain people. They should go back to the principles and values they had. I no longer recognise my club.”

Since Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital bought Chelsea,, the club has undergone a period of fast transition. More than $500 Million has been spent on the field, and the team is currently working with its third manager of the year.

Key administrators including Bruce Buck, Marina Granovskaia, and Petr Cech all left Stamford Bridge last Summer, as part of the club restructuring off the field.
