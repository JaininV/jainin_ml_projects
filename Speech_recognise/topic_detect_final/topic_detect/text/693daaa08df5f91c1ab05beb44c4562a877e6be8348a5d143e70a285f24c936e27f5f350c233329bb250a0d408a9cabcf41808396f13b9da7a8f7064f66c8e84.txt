According to reports, Real Madrid midfielder Federico Valverde punched a Villarreal player after the game between the two sides over the weekend.

Valverde reportedly punched Alex Baena in the parking lot after the game because of the shocking comment Baene made on Valverde’s wife’s miscarriage.

The Spanish Federation are yet to make a comment on the situation, but Alex Baena has released a statement saying that he has reported the matter to the police.

He wrote in a statement: “On Saturday I was physically attacked by another player after the match against Madrid.

“After that, statements allegedly made by his camp came to light, in which it was said that I wished pain to one of his family members. But no evidence has been shared.

“They took advantage of a tragedy to justify the aggression and there are lies that hurt more than the punches. The damage that my family has been receiving is unjustifiable… I have received threats, insults, and even people wishing death to my family.

“Yesterday I filed a report with the police. I will let justice do its job. My only goal now is to dedicate myself to football and support my club.”
