With winter weather giving way to Spring, farm vehicles will once again be on the roadways throughout the Finger Lakes.

Dan Welch with Cornell Cooperative Extension of Cayuga County says his organization is partnering with the Sheriff’s Office and New York Farm Bureau to remind motorists to share the road.

They’re reminding drivers that, whether it’s a piece of agricultural machinery or a horse and buggy, slow moving vehicles will have an orange triangle on the back of them, indicating their status as a slow moving vehicle.

Drivers are reminded that farm equipment typically travels under 40mph and needs extra space while making turns.

From 2016-2022, over 2,500 personal injury crashes were reported in the Cayuga County.
