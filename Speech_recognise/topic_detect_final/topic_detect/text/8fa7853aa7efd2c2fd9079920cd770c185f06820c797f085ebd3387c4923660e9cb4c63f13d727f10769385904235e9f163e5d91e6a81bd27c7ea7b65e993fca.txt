* The lowest wage that someone would accept for a new role is almost $2,100 higher than it was in November.

* The rise in expected salary levels comes at a time of historically low unemployment rates in America.

The reservation wage, or the lowest wage that someone would accept for a new role, is almost $2,100 higher than it was in November when the survey was last conducted, at which point the wage was $73,667. The survey asked respondents about the lowest wage or salary they would accept before taxes and other deductions if they were offered a job today in their line of work that they would consider.

To contextualize these expectations, the average American household earns a median income of under $70,000 a year, according to a March 8 report by financial technology company SmartAsset. The median household income was around $71,000 in 2021, per the United States Census Bureau, not significantly changed from 2020.

The rise in expected salary levels makes sense, as it comes at a time of historically low unemployment rates in America. And while there are some signs of cooling, it continues to be a red-hot workers' market. Civilian unemployment rates were at 3.5% in March, a touch higher than the 3.4% recorded in February, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. From 2003 to 2023, unemployment levels have been at that level only a handful of times — including the first quarter of 2020, which coincided with the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, per the bureau.

The central bank is trying to solve this cyclical problem, where employers — who face higher labor charges — are trying to recoup their costs by increasing the cost of goods and services. This, in turn, leads to employees upping their salary expectations to combat inflation's erosive effects.
