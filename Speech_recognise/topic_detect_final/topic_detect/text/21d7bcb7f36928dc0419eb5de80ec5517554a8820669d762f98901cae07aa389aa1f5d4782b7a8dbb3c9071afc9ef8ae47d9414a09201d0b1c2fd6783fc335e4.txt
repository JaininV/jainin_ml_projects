Webinar: How will regulatory updates impact FM sustainability and what will organisations have to do to comply?

There have been several updates to regulations impacting organisational sustainability over the last six months, requiring greater levels of disclosure. Within the UK, there is a greater focus upon supplier management of modern slavery with additional reporting for Government contracts and the inclusion of climate risk reporting in little over two years as part of Director level responsibilities.

Most importantly we are seeing a consolidation in the global reporting landscape with the release of the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) and EU Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) anticipated by end of June 2023. Both are similar in their aspirations and will certainly help to reduce the plethora of existing reporting requirements. The standards are expected to come into effect from early 2024 for use in annual reports.  The UK Government has already stated its intention to mandate this change.

The change means a move from data disclosure – which has always been open to abuse – to one that includes the behaviour of how companies operate and how they provide their data. The SFMI provides a means to measure and assess the implementation of those behaviours helping FM companies to demonstrate compliance with the upcoming standards.

The SFMI are holding a webinar on 25 April 2023 to discuss the regulations and what they mean for FM organisations as well as the proposed changes to the SFMI assessments criteria which could help organisations in a more demanding regulatory environment.
