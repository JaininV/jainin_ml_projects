The pair walked a short distance before he grabbed her and threw her to the ground, punching her in the face “numerous times” until she lost consciousness, Detective Superintendent Jayne Doherty said on Wednesday.“The girl was then sexually assaulted before the male fled along Bourke Street,” Doherty said. She sought help from nearby houses and ended up flagging down a car, which took her to Goulburn police station.“She reported the matter and was later taken to Goulburn hospital for treatment for facial injuries”.Doherty said investigations into the assault have led police to believe the attack may have been linked to a similar incident on April 5. On that occasion, an 18-year-old woman was walking along Blackshaw Road, Goulburn, about 10.30pm when she was approached by a man she didn’t know and punched to the ground.Police have released CCTV footage of a man with whom they would like to speak.“She was punched several times to the face but managed to break away and run away along Blackshaw Road.”Doherty said on both occasions the man’s initial approach “was not overly aggressive” and allowed him to get closer to the women.“He was talking to the women, and then he’s become suddenly aggressive, which is why they’ve been caught off guard and knocked to the ground.”Doherty said police “do not want people to be alarmed, but they should be alert. Alert to your surroundings, who may be walking the streets at night, or who may be acting of concern to you.”She said Goulburn police have put on extra patrols overnight to ensure the safety of the community.The man is described as being of Caucasian appearance, aged in his late 30s to early 40s, about 180cm tall, with a solid build, and a scruffy beard.“Someone in Goulburn knows who this male is, and that’s who we want to come forward.”Doherty urged Goulburn residents to review their CCTV and dashcam footage and “if anything comes up that’s of concern to you: report it to police”.The Morning Edition newsletter is our guide to the day’s most important and interesting stories, analysis and insights.
