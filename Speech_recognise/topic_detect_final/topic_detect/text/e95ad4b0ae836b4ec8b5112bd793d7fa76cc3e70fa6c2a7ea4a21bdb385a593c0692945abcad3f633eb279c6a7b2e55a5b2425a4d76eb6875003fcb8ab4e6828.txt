In this listener feedback episode I answer a variety of recent questions and feedback that you guys have sent me by email, social media, YouTube comments, etc.

Today we cover biochar, saving to buy a house, pesticides, sous vide cooking, real world meetups, college closures, parallel economies and more.

If you want to submit content or questions for a show like today’s the best thing to do is send an email about your topic or question to jack at thesurvivalpodcast.com with TSPC in the subject line.  Ask your question up front in one sentence or do the same with your point.  Then provide any additional details, references, links, etc. after that.  This is the best way to get though my show screening process.
