Many nail trends are created to mimic physical objects or other phenomena in the world. For example, the iconic chocolate glazed donut nails are designed to look like the icing of their tasty namesake, and sweater-inspired nail art is painted in shapes to recreate the stitching of a comfortable cable knit sweater.

Another nail trend that was created to look like something else is the oil-slick nail trend. Oil-slick nails are a type of holographic manicure and are great if you want to add a little extra shine. Similar to oil spills, oil-slick nails have a shiny black base and ribbons of color throughout that only appear in certain lighting.

There are a few different ways to create the oil-slick look. One method involves painting your nails black and then stacking droplets of nail polish in different colors on one of your nails. You can use a toothpick to swirl around the colors until you have your desired look and repeat the process on each nail. There are plenty of other ways to create oil-slick nails and variations you can try too.
