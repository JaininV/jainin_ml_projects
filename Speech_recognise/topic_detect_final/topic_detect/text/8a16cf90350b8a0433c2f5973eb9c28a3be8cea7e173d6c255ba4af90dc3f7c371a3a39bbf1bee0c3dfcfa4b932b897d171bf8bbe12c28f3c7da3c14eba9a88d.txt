Amman, Apr. 19 (Petra) -- Jordan is joining the rest of the world in celebrating World Heritage Day, which is observed on April 18 each year.

To mark the occasion, the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities on Tuesday illuminated the Kingdom's six World Heritage sites in blue, while selected archaeological sites were lit in violet.

Minister of Tourism and Antiquities Makram Qaisi stated that the occasion serves as a reminder of the strength of cultural and natural heritage at the local, national, and global levels, especially that such places reflect the accomplishments of earlier civilizations, their diversity, inventiveness, social relations, values, and beliefs.

"World Heritage Day urges us to celebrate all of the world's cultures in general, and our six sites in particular, as well as to spread awareness of significant cultural monuments and places," he added.

With six locations listed as UNESCO World Heritage Sites, including the Baptism Site of Jesus Christ, Petra, Qasr Amra, Umm ar-Rasas, Wadi Rum, and As-Salt, Qaisi indicated that Jordan aspires to offer a basis of a framework for global cooperation in preserving and sustaining cultural assets and natural places around the world.

Director of the Department of Antiquities, Fadi Balawi, said that world heritage is a resource that belongs to all humankind, and the international community must work together to conserve and preserve it as a priceless treasure.

He added that Jordan's six sites on the World Heritage List and the 15 sites on the tentative list have received the department's full attention to safeguard, enhance, and maintain them.

Additionally, he noted that the department will organize a variety of events and activities that aim to raise awareness about the importance of cultural heritage and encourage people to explore and appreciate the country's rich history.
