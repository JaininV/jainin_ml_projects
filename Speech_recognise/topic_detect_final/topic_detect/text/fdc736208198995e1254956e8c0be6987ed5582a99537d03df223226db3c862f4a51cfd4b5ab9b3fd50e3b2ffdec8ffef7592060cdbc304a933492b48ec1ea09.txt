KUALA LUMPUR, April 15 — Popular K-pop group BTS will be performing the opening soundtrack for upcoming South Korean animated TV series Bastions.

According to YonHap News Agency, the series will see the supergroup coming together once again for the show's theme song.

BTS' last appearance as a group was through their anthology album Proof which was released in June last year. Since then, the group members have branched out to focus on their own solo careers.

According to the series production house Thymos Media, Bastions follows the story of a group of rookie superheroes. They try to save the earth after learning the identity of a villain who is responsible for environmental destruction.

The animated series is set to air on May 14 on South Korean TV channel SBS.

“BTS is expected to provide an overwhelming sense of immersion to the emotions and action scenes of the series by singing the theme song in perfect harmony,” Thymos Media said.

Although the full song is not out yet, a 30-second teaser of the theme song has made its way to the show's social media.

Aside from that, Bastions will see K-pop girl group Le Sserafim and singers Heize and AleXa participating on its soundtrack.
