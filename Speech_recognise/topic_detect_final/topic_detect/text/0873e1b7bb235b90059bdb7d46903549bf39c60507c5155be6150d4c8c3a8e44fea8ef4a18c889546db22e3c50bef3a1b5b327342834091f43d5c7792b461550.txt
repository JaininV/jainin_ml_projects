As one of those readers, my reaction was two-fold: a) I immediately started channeling Joey Tribbiani and wondering  WHY GOD WHY? WE HAD A DEAL, and b) how on earth am I going to maintain access to all the books I want? I’m lucky that there are two English-language bookstores in my area, but the selection is hardly the same. And after my lone purchase of a single book through Amazon over a decade ago, and finding that the shipping was far more expensive than the book itself, I stopped using any and all stores that weren’t Book Depository for my international book buying needs.
