Amid the halted Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations, Israel Economy Minister Nir Barkat on April 18 in Delhi hinted towards the peace possibility between both countries which can be only achieved over certain conditions. Counting the conditions, Barkat assured that Israel will do peace with Palestine if they come up with a ‘real deal’ and stop teaching their ‘children to kill Jews’. “When Palestinians come up with the real will to do peace, we will strike peace with Palestinians. We are able to negotiate a good deal with them, but they need to stop teaching their children to kill Jews,” Barkat said. Recently, China also expressed its wish to aid both the countries in resuming their halted peace talks, which have been stalling since 2014.
