Dozens of police officers have been put at risk after a top secret document with details regarding Joe Biden’s visit to Belfast was found on the street.

A member of the public discovered the document containing a detailed itinerary of the trip and the £7 million security operation.

BBC Radio Ulster’s Nolan Show reported that the Police Service Northern Ireland document included the names of all PSNI officers involved in the security operation as well as the phone numbers and addresses of top PSNI officers.

Police officers in Northern Ireland already have to take extra precautions due to the threat from dissident Republicans and the discovery comes a day after four suspected pipe bombs were found at the scene of an illegal march in Londonderry.

Police were attacked for a second day in Londonderry as officers made safe the crude homemade devices, just hours before the US president arrived in Belfast to mark the 25th Anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement.
