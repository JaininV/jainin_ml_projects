Rachel McAdams has been branded as brave and inspiring after proudly flaunting her hairy underarms in her latest photoshoot.

The 44-year-old Canadian actress, who is best known for her roles in the likes of The Notebook and Mean Girls, showed off her hairy armpits without a second thought as she posed for stunning photos for Bustle magazine.

According to the publication, McAdams not only showed off her body hair but also insisted only minimal editing was done on her photos.

In one of her snaps, Rachel is seen lying comfortably on the sofa with her arms wide open. In another, she’s seen sporting a white, skin-tight dress that accentuated her curves and the hair in her left armpit.

“With this shoot, I’m wearing latex underwear. But I’ve had two children. This is my body, and I think that’s so important to reflect back out to the world,” the actress told Bustle.

“It’s OK to look your best and work at it and be healthy, but that’s different for everyone.”

Elsewhere in the interview, McAdams also opened up about her career as she revealed that taking a break from acting helped her take back control and feel empowered.

“[It] really helped me feel empowered. It helped me feel like I was taking back some control. And I think it sort of allowed me to come in from a different doorway,” she said.

“I felt guilty for not capitalizing on the opportunity that I was being given, because I knew I was in such a lucky spot. But I also knew it wasn’t quite jiving with my personality and what I needed to stay sane.”

The photoshoot comes amid McAdams’ promotion of her upcoming movie ‘Are You There God? It’s Me Margaret.’ The comedy-drama is an adaptation of the namesake novel by author Judy Blume.
