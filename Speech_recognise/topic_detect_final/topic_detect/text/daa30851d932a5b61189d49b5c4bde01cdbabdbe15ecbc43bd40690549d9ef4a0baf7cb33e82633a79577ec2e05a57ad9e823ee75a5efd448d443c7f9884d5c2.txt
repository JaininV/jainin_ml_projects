Twitter war between External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and Congress leader Siddamramaiah has erupted over the latter's remark that 31 tribals from Karnataka are stuck in crisis-hit Sudan and allegation of government inaction in bringing them back. On Tuesday, Siddaramaiah had appealed to the state and Central governments to rescue tribals from Karnataka stuck in crisis-hit Sudan, alleging that no action has been taken so far, to which Jaishankar had replied: "I am appalled at your tweet! There are lives at stake; don't do politics."
