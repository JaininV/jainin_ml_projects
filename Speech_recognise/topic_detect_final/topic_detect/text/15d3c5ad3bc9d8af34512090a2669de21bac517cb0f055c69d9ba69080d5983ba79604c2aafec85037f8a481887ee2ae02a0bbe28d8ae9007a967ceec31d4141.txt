Khloé Kardashian celebrated her daughter's big milestone with a series of adorable photos of them together over the years, and of True at different stages of her childhood. She posted the snaps on her Instagram Story after sharing a message that read, "Today is my [angel’s] 5th birthday!! I am NOT OK. Try has changed my life in ways I could never express. I am so emotional over her getting older. What is wrong with me lol." Ahead of the pictures, she wrote, "A walk down memory lane…. Sobbing. True I love you beyond measure."

Amongst the images was a sweet shot of True as a newborn, swaddled in a pink blanket and napping on a white-and-pink bed. Kardashian then shared photos of True over the years—with her at home, being silly with her cousins, and looking happy in different cute outfits.

In one selfie of the two, Kardashian wears a black spaghetti-strap top while carrying True, who wears a breezy light blue stop with little flower embellishments, a white layered skirt, and tiny diamond studs.

The Good America co-founder also shared black-and-white photos of herself when she was pregnant with True.

Kardashian welcomed her daughter with ex-boyfriend Tristan Thompson on April 12, 2018. And in August 2022, they welcomed their second child, a boy whose name they have not yet publicly disclosed (thou Kardashian did recently give a hint, saying her son's name starts with a "T" like True and Tristan).

Kardashian's mom, Kris Jenner, also shared a tribute for her granddaughter today by sharing an Instagram post filled with photos of the five-year-old. "Happy birthday to my beautiful granddaughter True!!!! You are such a gorgeous light with your mesmerizing smile and your effervescent personality that captures our hearts and lights up every room!" she wrote. "Thank you for bringing so much happiness, joy, and love to our family. I love you so much TuTu and I am so blessed that God chose me to be your grandmother."
