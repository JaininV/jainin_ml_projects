“On Easter Sunday, many Albertans of the Christian faith will commemorate the resurrection of Jesus Christ following remembrance of his crucifixion on Good Friday.

“On this holy day, the most important on the Christian calendar, Christians worldwide will gather in community to celebrate the day good triumphed over evil. For the global Christian community, this day is at the core of their beliefs and the centre of their hope.

“To all those celebrating Easter, I extend my best wishes for a special time with family and loved ones.”
