Flaring at the Phillips 66 refinery in Rodeo is under investigation, Contra Costa Health Services said.

The flaring was reported late Tuesday. It sent dark smoke drifting in the area and could be seen across the Bay Area.

A hazardous materials team responded to monitor air quality. The air monitoring did not indicate any impacts to public health, according to Contra Costa Health Services.

Phillips 66 provided the following statement to NBC Bay Area:

"At approximately 5 p.m. Tuesday, April 11, the Phillips 66 Rodeo Refinery experienced flaring due to a temporary loss of power. Our trained teams are responding and working to stop the ongoing flaring. All refinery safety systems functioned as designed, and all appropriate regulatory notifications have been made. There are no injuries, and all personnel are safe. Regulatory agencies and refinery personnel have been conducting air monitoring. The safety of the community, the environment and our people is our companyâ€™s top priority. Flares are important safety devices used in refineries and petrochemical facilities. They safely burn excess hydrocarbon gases that cannot be recovered or recycled."
