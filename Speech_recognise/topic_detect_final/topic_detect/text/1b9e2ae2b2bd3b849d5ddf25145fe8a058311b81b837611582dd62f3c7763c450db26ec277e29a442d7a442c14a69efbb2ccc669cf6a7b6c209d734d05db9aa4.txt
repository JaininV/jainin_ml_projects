GORHAM – Principal Tina Binette is pleased to announce that the Ed Fenn Elementary School held a successful Learning Fair.

Ed Fenn held the school’s annual Learning Fair after school on April 6. The Learning Fair is a celebration of thinking, questioning and creativity, and showcases a variety of student interests including topics such as science, history, animals, and more.

Student art lined the hallway as families made their way to classrooms to see the various projects students have worked on throughout the year. Projects included STEM presentations, Lego engineering, animal habitats made by kindergarten students and Oregon Trail projects made by fifth graders.

“This year we had an amazing turn out. It was so wonderful to see families come and see the students’ amazing work,” said Principal Tina Binette. “The Learning Fair gives students the opportunity to share their accomplishments with pride.”
