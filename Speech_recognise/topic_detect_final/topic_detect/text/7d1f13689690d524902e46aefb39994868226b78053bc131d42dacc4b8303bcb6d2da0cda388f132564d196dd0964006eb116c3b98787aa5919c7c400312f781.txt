Chelsea midfielder Enzo Fernandez has hailed the role former Chelsea striker Hernan Crespo has played in his young career.

“We already know what Hernan was like as a player,” Enzo told Chelsea’s official website. “He has proved it over the years, but as a person too he’s a top guy.

“He always tries to help, always gives advice. He’s spent many years as a player and he always has stories to tell and whenever I needed him, he was always there.

“He has taught me a lot on the field because he was my coach at Defensa y Justicia. We won the Copa Sudamericana together and I always mention that he taught me so many things.

“I had just come from River Plate after not playing in the first team and playing in the second team for a long time, and going to Defensa y Justicia was very good for my mind, to keep growing, to keep maturing and to gain experience there. It was very important for me.

“Besides Hernan, his coaching staff was also very good, he always tried to help us and I have learned a lot from him, he has always advised me well – super football-gifted, he knows a lot about football.”
