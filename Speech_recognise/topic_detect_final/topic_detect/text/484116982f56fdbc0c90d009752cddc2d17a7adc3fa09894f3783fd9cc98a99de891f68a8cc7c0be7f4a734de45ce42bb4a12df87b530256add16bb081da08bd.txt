The Labour Party has 14 seats on the list, while the Peoples Democratic Party has the remaining 10 seats.

INECâ€™s Head of Voter Education and Publicity in Enugu State, Mr Rex Achumie, issued the list detailing the names, constituencies, parties and number of votes scored by the members-elect at the March 18 election.

Achumie urged members of the public to disregard any unauthorised list posted on social media or in online media but not issued by INEC.
