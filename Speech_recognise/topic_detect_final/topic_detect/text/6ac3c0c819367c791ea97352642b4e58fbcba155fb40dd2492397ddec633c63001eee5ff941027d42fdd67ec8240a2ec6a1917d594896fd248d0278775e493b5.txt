The NBA suspended Draymond Green for one game without pay for stomping on Domantas Sabonis’ chest in Game 2 of the first round series between the Warriors and Kings.

Golden State will be without one of its leaders in Game 3 at home while trailing 0-2 in the series. Damian Lillard does not think that Green’s action warranted a suspension.
