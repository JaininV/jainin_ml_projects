At the 2023 Breakthrough Prize Ceremony, the red carpet was filled with A-list stars, including Miranda Kerr, Gal Gadot, Kristen Bell and Christina Aguilera.

However, Katharine McPhee’s vibrant style stole the show, where she left a lasting impression in a dazzling deep red gown.

The 39-year-old American singer-songwriter radiated elegance as she walked the red carpet with her beloved 73-year-old husband, David Foster, at the ninth annual celebration at the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures in Los Angeles on Saturday night.

McPhee’s outfit was a showstopper at the ceremony, which recognizes the world’s top scientists, featuring a Gemy Maalouf dress with a silky strapless bodice and a beautifully draped skirt that flowed down to the ground.

The gown was tailored to highlight her toned figure and featured a folded neckline, providing an extra sophisticated touch.

To complete her look, McPhee carried a red satin purse from Tyler Ellis that matched the color scheme of her outfit.

Adding more glamour to her ensemble, McPhee adorned herself with a diamond necklace set in gold, drop earrings, and several rings that provided a bright, refined touch.

The former American Idol contestant’s luscious locks were impeccably styled in loose, effortless waves, creating a cascading effect that gracefully flowed past her shoulders, accentuating her stunning red-carpet look after being parted in the middle.

McPhee’s footwear comprised scarlet pointed-toe shoes with dark red lacquered soles and crystal-lined upper straps, adding an extra elegance element.

However, they were mainly concealed beneath her gown, revealing only the clear triangular toes and slim stiletto heels that gave the pair a sleek twist.

McPhee was accompanied by David Foster, a renowned musician whom she married in 2019 and with whom she has a two-year-old child, a son named Rennie David Foster.

The age gap between the stunning couple, with Foster being 35 years her senior, didn’t stop them from looking like a perfect match as they posed for the cameras on the red carpet.

Foster flawlessly coordinated his attire with his wife’s, elevating them to the status of a perfect power couple. He looked dapper in a classic tuxedo and bowtie with a light blue handkerchief in his pocket, complemented by black slacks and shining leather dress shoes.

The twosome first met on American Idol in 2006 when McPhee was 21 and a contestant while Foster was 56 and a guest mentor. They had a lavish wedding ceremony at the Church of Saint Yeghiche in South Kensington, London, on June 28, 2019.

It was McPhee’s second marriage. Meanwhile, it was Foster’s fifth, following his previous marriages to Linda Thompson, B. J. Cook, Rebecca Dyer, and Yolanda Hadid, a star from The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills and Gigi Hadid’s mom. He also shares five daughters from his past relationships.
