Opposition Leader Peter Dutton relinquishing a Liberal post in the shadow cabinet for a National is “pretty much unheard of,” says Sky News Political Editor Andrew Clennell.

“If Peter Dutton was hoping that David Littleproud would give up a shadow cabinet post in return to the Liberals, he was out of luck,” Mr Clennell said.

“Mr Dutton told me yesterday this was a ‘beltway issue’.”
