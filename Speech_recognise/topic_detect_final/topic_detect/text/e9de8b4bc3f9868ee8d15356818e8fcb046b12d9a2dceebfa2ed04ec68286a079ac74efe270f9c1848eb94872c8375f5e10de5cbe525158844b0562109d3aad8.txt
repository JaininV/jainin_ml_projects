If excitement is what the Pioneers wanted on eighth grade night, then the WCMS baseball team didn't leave disappointed. Monday's game against Grundy County was one of the wildest of the year.

Warren County overcame four errors, recovered from an early eight-run deficit and got a walk-off single from Carter Lee to beat the Yellow Jackets 14-13. It was the ninth win for WCMS and came on a night where the team celebrated 10 eighth-graders (Pictured on 4B), all of whom played a role in the win.

" We didn't play to our best ability - our defense and the mental aspect did not exist for a while. I will say this, I'm proud of the boys because they didn't give up or throw in the towel," said coach Chad Young. "We had some clutch  hits and pitching to seal the deal."

Grundy County led 12-4 going into the bottom of the fourth, mostly powered by a five-run second frame that featured two Pioneer errors and crucial walks. When Warren County got back into the dugout though, a flip switched.

John Brock provided the spark, with his two-out, two-run homer getting the Pioneers rolling. His long bomb to center made it 12-8.

Preston McAbee's RBI double kept the comeback attempt rolling, while Brock and Lee each hit a sac fly as WCMS got the deficit down to 12-11.

Grundy added some insurance in the seventh with a run, but it wasn't enough. Huck Damon scored on a passed ball to make it  a one-run game again, then the Pioneers loaded the bases. Daylen Holguin tied the game with a RBI groundout before Lee delivered the knockout blow - a hard shot to first that was too hot to handle. Ryder Gilispie was able to score as a wild celebration ensued.

Lee finished the game with a team-high four RBIs, while Brady Norris and Braden Whinnery had three hits each. Jack Moore picked up the win, working four strong innings in relief to slow the Grundy County offense.
