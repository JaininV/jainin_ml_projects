Feverse, a virtual girl group formed on Kakao Entertainment's program, "GIRL'S RE:VERSE," will burst onto the K-pop scene next month.

Feverse will put out its debut track, "CHO" on May 9, according to Kakao. The group will premiere the song in a special fan event, which will take place one day before its official release.

Feverse consists of the five winners from "GIRL'S RE:VERSE": Muneo, Seoritae, Keuang, Rien and Kimserena. They are the virtual avatars of different K-pop girl group members, whose identities have been concealed. "GIRL's RE:VERSE" is Korea's first survivor show featuring virtual idols, in which 30 K-pop stars went head-to-head. The 12-episode program wrapped up on March 6.

According to Kakao, "CHO" was composed by acclaimed songwriters who were behind the success of numerous K-pop hits. Its choreography was also crafted by a popular dance team that previously worked with several K-pop girl groups. But Kakao did not mention their names.

"Feverse members are passionately preparing for their debut," Kakao said in a statement, Wednesday. "They will showcase their new sides that were not seen on 'GIRL'S RE:VERSE.'"
