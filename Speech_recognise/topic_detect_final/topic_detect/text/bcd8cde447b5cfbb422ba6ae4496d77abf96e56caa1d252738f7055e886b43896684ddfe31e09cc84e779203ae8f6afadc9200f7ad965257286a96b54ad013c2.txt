I just read about the shooting at Seaside Park. My husband and I were just leaving after we took our usual walk there. We kept commenting to each other how this park has just changed from last year. Hundreds of younger adults everywhere, blasting music, drugs, open liquor, speeding motorcycles doing wheelies everywhere! Where’s the police, we wondered. So when leaving we saw three cop cars at the entrance and the cops hanging out talking! Why weren’t they patrolling the park? No wonder three people were shot and one officer hurt. If they were patrolling like they should have been, maybe this wouldn’t have occurred. But who am I to say? We’re just Bridgeport residents who just want to enjoy the beautiful beach!
