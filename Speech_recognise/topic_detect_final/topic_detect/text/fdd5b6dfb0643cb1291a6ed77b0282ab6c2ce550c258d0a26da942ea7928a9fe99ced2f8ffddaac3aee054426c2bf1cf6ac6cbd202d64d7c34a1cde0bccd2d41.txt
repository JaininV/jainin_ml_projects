Steps:

③ Destination, select any OVDC and enter a name different from the original vApp name for Restored vApp name: (e.g. add "_restored" etc.)

※ If you click "Next" here, the "Datastore" tab displayed on the left disappear.

④ Network, select any network

Is this a bug?

Hello,

As far as I see, support cannot reproduce the behavior you see. So it looks like a bug, yes. The easiest way is to ask support "is this a bug or a feature. if it's a bug, can I please get the bug number"? That ensures it gets tracked properly.

Just to be sure: did you already upgrade to the latest update from last week?

Best regards,

Hannes
