Well-known lawyer, Honorary Lawyer of Russia Dmitry Krasnov I found the video weirdcirculating on social networks. In the footage, women allegedly from border villages in the Bryansk region turn to Ukrainian saboteurs, practically inviting them to Russia, and talk about checkpoints and the number of border guards. The human rights activist considers this material to be discredited by the Russian military and is convinced that the competent authorities should give a legal assessment to this “welcome, Bandera people”.

In his Telegram channel, lawyer Krasnov doubted the veracity of the story: “they blatantly lie on a piece of paper in their hand that ‘three border guards are guarding three villages, but there is no of checkpoints”. In addition, the author of the video also raises a question.

“I collected, warmed up and recorded the rebellion of this woman against the background of an expensive Mercedes by a deputy of the Bryansk Legislative Assembly. I understand that MPs want PR. But I also understand that a regional deputy has no immunity, ”said the lawyer.

The human rights activist also promised that he would appeal to the Bryansk prosecutor’s office if such a provocation with the invitation of terrorists to Russia goes unpunished.
