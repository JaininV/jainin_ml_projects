Starting with 2009's "Antichrist," Charlotte Gainsbourg would star in two more films for director Lars von Trier in what became his "Depression Trilogy." The last was 2013's "Nymphomaniac," and the middle film was 2011's existential, end-of-the-world drama "Melancholia." The feature is notorious for including one of the most twisted weddings in cinema history, but critics acclaimed its emotional power, and the film won several awards.

Gainsbourg stars as Claire, the sister of the protagonist Justine (Kirsten Dunst), and the focus of the feature's second half after Justine's story in the first segment. Her character's understandable despair as a rogue planet approaches a collision with Earth allows the actor to display a full range of emotions as she grapples with her impending demise.

Speaking to Salon in 2011, the interviewer expressed confusion in explaining the film, which Gainsbourg attributed to von Trier's beguiling aesthetic. She said, "It's difficult to sum it up. I've never had to try! I get that Lars' films are all so personal. Reading the script, I really didn't know where he was going, or what was behind it." The "I'm Not There" star added that the filmmaker's ambiguity towards the material was enough for her to just interpret the story to her liking, just as she did when working with the filmmaker on "Antichrist."

Her next significant English-language role would see the actor tackle the Hollywood blockbuster circuit.
