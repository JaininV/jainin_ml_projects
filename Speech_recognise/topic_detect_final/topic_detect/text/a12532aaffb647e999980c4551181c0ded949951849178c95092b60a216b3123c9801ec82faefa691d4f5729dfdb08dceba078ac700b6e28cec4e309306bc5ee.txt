The Cle de Peau UV Protective Lip Treatment SPF30 is back and it comes in a new refillable format. I tried the original version of this UV protective lip balm back in 2019 and absolutely loved it. I am so happy to have it back in my life. Here’s what you need to know.

This is such a gorgeous lip balm. It melts into the lips and leaves them looking plump and juicy. I absolutely love that it has UVA and UVB filters with SPF30 because the lips are super delicate and I don’t think they are always as protected from the environment as they could be.

It makes the most beautiful base for lip colour, and it’s perfect for topping up moisture levels and protection during the day because it comes in such a convenient tube. It’s really luxurious and pretty expensive at £53, but it absolutely ticks every single box for me! I never have dry lips when I use this.

In fact, Cle de Peau lip balms are up there with my all time favourites. I am obsessed with the Cle de Peau Lip Glorifiers, and I have got so many people hooked on them. If you are looking for a balm that’s intensely hydrating and plumping, and also gives a soft tint of colour, you literally can’t beat them. Read my Cle de Peau Lip Glorifier Review.

The Cle de Peau UV Protective Lip Treatment SPF30 can be layered under any lip product to make sure your lips are protected, so this will be the perfect option to take on your holidays.

I love that it now comes in a refillable format too.
