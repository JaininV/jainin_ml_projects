The Australian Securities and Investments Commission had been evaluating evidence of unethical conduct and breaches of the law by corporate cowboy Kristofer (Kris) Ridgway for more than a year without an outcome.

The regulator sat on its hands until a promotion for an investigation by The Age, The Sydney Morning Herald and 60 Minutes into the Brisbane businessman’s dealings was broadcast last Wednesday night. The following morning ASIC issued a press release announcing Ridgway had been permanently banned from having any involvement in financial services. The timing would be comical if not so cynical.

ASIC’s investigations have a glacial slowness and, faced with potentially embarrassing media exposure, Australia’s corporate regulator may have wanted to appear ahead of the game. But the reality is that ASIC is a watchdog few fear.

Ridgway used his position at the Brisbane office of finance house Shaw and Partners as a middleman in a global investment scheme to lure unsophisticated investors to buy shares in unlisted companies with the expectation that they would soon be listed and deliver a windfall. Years later, the companies remain unlisted and investors have not received a cent. Our investigation uncovered other Australian financial advisers using their trusted positions to convince clients to buy the same dubious investments right under ASIC’s nose.
