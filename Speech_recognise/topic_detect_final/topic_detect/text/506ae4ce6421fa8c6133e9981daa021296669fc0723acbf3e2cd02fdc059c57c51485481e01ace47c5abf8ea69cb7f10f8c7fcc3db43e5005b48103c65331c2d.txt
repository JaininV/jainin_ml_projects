The good news continues to roll in from Gordon Murray Automotive (GMA). We already knew that the T.33 was destined for our shores, and while the even more extreme T.50 is not technically road legal in the USA, we now know that a few lucky customers will be able to import it under the Show or Display law.

With that technicality out of the way, we can focus on everything that makes this car so special, including a naturally-aspirated V12 that makes 656 horsepower and can rev all the way to 12,100 rpm. The T.50 is incredibly light considering its power, and the central driving position creates an intimate experience that is as close to piloting a Formula 1 car as possible - that's no surprise with Gordon Murray at the helm of GMA, designer of both the iconic McLaren F1 and racing cars for McLaren and Brabham. In fact, Murray himself said that the T.50 is "the next F1," and that should tell you everything you need to know about this special machine.
