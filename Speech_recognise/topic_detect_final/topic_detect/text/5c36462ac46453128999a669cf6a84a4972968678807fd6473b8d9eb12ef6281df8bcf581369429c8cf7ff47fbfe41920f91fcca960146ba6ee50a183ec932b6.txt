Rachel Finn grapples with life after loss. Showcasing an inspiring outlook on moving forward through trauma in an unapologetically true-to-herself way that brings a smile to everyone who crosses her path. Oh, and she catches some big FF&#@ING fish.

You can pick up your tickets ($15 a head check or cash) from Dally’s Ozark Fly Fisher and Natural State Fly Shops in Cotter, Three Rivers Fly Shop in Norfork and Southern Breeze Realty in Mountain Home for what is expected to be another epic Memorial Day evening on the banks of the White River.

The organising team continue to grow the festival surrounding the F3T fly fishing film showing, with live music, multiple food trucks and two local craft beer vendors all in one of the most spectacular venues for an F3T event in the country.

The F3T (Fly Fishing Film Tour) is a national event, this year with 10 short fly fishing films, including both official F3T events and locally hosted events like Cotter’s unique Under The Bridge Festival.

The natural amphitheater of Big Spring Park provides the perfect setting for the festival with with famed waters of the White River flowing by. The eastern most abutment of the historic bridge forms the screen for the showing.

The Festival opens around 6pm with live music from Mountain Home’s Ozark Blues Revival band. Multiple food trucks will be operating to help patrons stave off hunger pangs and for the first time a choice of our two premier local craft brewers Rapp’s Barren Brewing Co, and Norfork Brewing Company.

The films are presented by major sponsorship by Dally’s and Potter Block Properties and other festival sponsors.
