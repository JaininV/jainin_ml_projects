Fijian Warriors coach Senirusi Seruvakula says he hopes a majority of his players will break into the Fijian Drua and Flying Fijians sides in the near future.

The Flying Fijians assistant coach will guide the team to the World Rugby Pacific Challenge which will be held in Samoa next month.

The 28-member squad is made up of mostly players from the Fiji Under-20 squad, with two over 23-year-old players adding their experience.

Seruvakula said the side is “the A team for young developing players”.

“This team serves as a development pathway for young players into the Swire Shipping Fijian Drua and hopefully the Flying Fijians,” the former Flying Fijian forward said.

“Who knows, maybe by next year a few of these players will be knocking on the door of the Fijian Drua and Flying Fijians.”

During a training session at the USP grounds in Suva, Seruvakula said one of the main purposes of his side was to produce high-quality players who will one day represent the country on a more professional scale.

He said with the Fiji Warriors being a “capped team”, they were able to keep players over a few years without other clubs and countries poaching them.

“This allows us to develop and build these players to reach their full potential, at the same time giving them the chance to represent the country on an international and professional level.”

Seruvakula brings a lot of experience to the team having led the Rooster Chicken Fijiana Drua to their historic Super W Championship win.

The side will face World Rugby Pacific Challenge champion Japan in its first game on May 3.

“Right now we are preparing for our first game against Japan at the World Rugby Pacific Challenge in Samoa and we just cant wait to run onto the field,” Seruvakula said.

The side will take on Manuma Samoa on May 8 before facing Tonga on May 13.

The team will be captained by Enele Malele.
