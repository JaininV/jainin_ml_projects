Minister of Tourism and international transport, Ian Gooding-Edghill is in support of Barbados embracing casino gambling.

Government in a bid to boost tourism back in 2012 had granted permission for cruise ships docked in Barbados to allow casino gambling.

Sharing his personal view on this morning’s Q100.7FM’s Let’s Talk About It show with host, Peter Wickham, the Minister says there is a place for casino gambling, noting opportunities also exist to build out additional capacity through casino gambling.

It was also revealed by Minister Gooding-Edghill that negotiations are continuing as the Government seeks a qualified private investor to operate the Grantley Adams International Airport (GAIA) through a public-private partnership.

Though not going into detail so as not to prejudice the discussions, he says the arrangement is to improve the operations at the airport.
