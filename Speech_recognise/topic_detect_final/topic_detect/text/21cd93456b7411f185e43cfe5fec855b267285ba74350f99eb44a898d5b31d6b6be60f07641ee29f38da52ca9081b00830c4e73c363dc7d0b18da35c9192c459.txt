The Arkansas Single Parent Scholarship Fund (ASPSF) has recently announced an increase in scholarship amounts for the Fall 2023 semester. The organization states they are excited to be able to offer more financial support to eligible single parents who are pursuing higher education.

Full-time eligible single parents can now receive $1,600 per semester, which is an increase from the previous amount of $1,200. Part-time students will also receive a prorated amount based on the number of enrolled hours. This increase in scholarship amounts is expected to provide more support to single parents who are trying to balance the demands of school, work, and family.

ASPSF Executive Director, Ruthanne Hill, expressed her excitement about the increase in scholarship amounts, saying, “Everything’s gotten more expensive, and the single parent scholarship doesn’t stretch as far as it used to. We know that, and we want to help. We hope the increased scholarship amount will offset some of those increases.”

The ASPSF has been providing support to single parents in Arkansas for over 30 years. The organization’s mission is to empower single parents by providing them with the financial assistance they need to pursue their educational goals. This increase in scholarship amounts is just one of the many ways that ASPSF is fulfilling its mission and supporting single parents in Arkansas.

ASPSF is currently accepting scholarship applications for the Fall 2023 semester until June 15th. Eligible single parents can apply for the scholarship by visiting www.aspsf.org/applynow and eligibility guidelines can be found online at www.aspsf.org/eligibility.
