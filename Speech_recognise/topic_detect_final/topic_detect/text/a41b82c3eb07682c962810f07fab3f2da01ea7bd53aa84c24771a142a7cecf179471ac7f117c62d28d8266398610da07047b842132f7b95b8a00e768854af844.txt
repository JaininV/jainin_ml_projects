Aiden Markram is well-known for his sensational fielding efforts in the outfield. He has taken some exceptional catches in his career so far. Things does not seem to be changing now when he is the captain of Sunrisers Hyderabad too as he acrobatically flies in the air near mid-on to take the catch of dangerous Suryakumar Yadav. Just a little time earlier, Markram also took anther very good catch dismissing Ishan Kishan.
