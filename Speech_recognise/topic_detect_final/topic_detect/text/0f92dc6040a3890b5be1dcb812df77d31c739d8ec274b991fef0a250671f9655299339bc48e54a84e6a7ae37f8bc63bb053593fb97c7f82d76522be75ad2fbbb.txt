On Tuesday, he announced the digital break and shared a long note informing his fans that he wants to spend some more time in the real world and not this digital bubble.

Taking to his Instagram handle, Aditya writes, “Before anyone jumps the gun, let me inform all my well wishers that I’m absolutely fine. I am on a digital break, happily spending time with my daughter, wife, parents and loved ones along with putting finishing touches to my debut album ‘Saansein’. Why have I deleted all posts from Instagram? Because it’s like my digital canvas, and I wish to erase my previous imprints and begin afresh, as if starting a new painting.”

The singer also mentions that he wishes to acquire new skills and hone his old ones along with indulging in a few trivial activities. He reveals that he will be back in July.
