The letter also noted some DVD trivia. “Beetlejuice,” starring Michael Keaton and Geena Davis, was the first DVD shipped by the company, in March 1998. The most frequently requested was the feel-good film “The Blind Side,” starring Sandra Bullock. And the company has sent out more than 5.2 billion DVDs over the years.

Netflix made the DVD announcement as part of its earnings report for the first quarter, which illustrated just how dominant streaming has become for the company. Drafting off a strong fourth quarter, when the company added 7.7 million subscribers, Netflix again posted positive numbers, with revenue rising 4 percent from a year earlier to $8.1 billion and profit hitting $1.3 billion. The company said that its average paid memberships had increased 4 percent over last year, and that it had added 1.75 million subscribers. Netflix’s subscriber base now totals 232.5 million around the world.

The results were a welcome relief to a company facing serious headwinds, including a possible writers’ strike, increased streaming competition and a burgeoning live business, which faltered over the weekend when technical difficulties delayed Netflix’s much-hyped “Love Is Blind” reunion show.

While revealing few details, Netflix said that it was pleased with the performance of its new advertising tier, which offers monthly subscriptions for as little as $6.99, and that it had seen scant evidence that people were switching from its standard and premium plans down to its cheaper ad-supported plan.

The company also said its attempts to crack down on password sharing in four markets — Portugal, Spain, New Zealand and Canada — were going well. In Canada, the company said, its paid membership base is now larger than before the crackdown, and revenue growth is now faster than in the United States.
