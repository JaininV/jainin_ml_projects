The image above comes from the average of two, 120-second exposures, taken with the wide field of view, fast 135mm-f/2 astrograph + Paramount ME + ZWO ASI 6200MC Pro robotic unit part of the Virtual Telescope Project.

Venus is the brightest object in the night sky after the Moon. Here it is an handful of degrees away from the Pleiades, the glorious star cluster visible in the upper left. A satellite trail is also visibile.

On 10 Apr. 2023, a new imaging session was performed, with the same gear mentioned above. Some thin clouds made a wonderful corona around Venus well visible, see below.

We planned a live feed showing this amazing meeting live: join us online, next 11 Apr. 2023!
