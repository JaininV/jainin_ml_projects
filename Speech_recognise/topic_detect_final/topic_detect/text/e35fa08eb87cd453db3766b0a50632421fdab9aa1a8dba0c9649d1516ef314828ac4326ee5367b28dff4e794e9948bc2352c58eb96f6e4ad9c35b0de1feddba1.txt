Officially launched in March 2020 with its protocol designed to facilitate decentralized app (DApp) creation, Solana remains committed to improving scalability by introducing a proof-of-history (PoH) consensus combined with the underlying proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus of the blockchain.

Because of the innovative hybrid consensus model, Solana enjoys interest from small-time traders and institutional traders alike and can be used for transactions, staking, and governance on the Solana network. SOL has gained significant popularity and adoption since its launch, with a growing community of developers and users building on the platform.

Shiba Inu coin is a cryptocurrency named after the popular Japanese dog breed and is based on a popular internet meme featuring the Shiba Inu dog.
