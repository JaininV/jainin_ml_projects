After launching the Xiaomi 13 Pro (Review) flagship earlier this year, Xiaomi is now back to the limelight with the launch of the new Xiaomi 13 Ultra which shapes up to be the most powerful smartphone launched by the company thus far.

The latest model brings along several noteworthy upgrades over last year’s Xiaomi 12S Ultra which not only include a faster processor and charging speed, but also a wealth of upgrades to it’s Leica-branded camera system.

Let’s start off with it’s main camera. It’s the same 1” Sony IMX989 sensor as the 12S Ultra, but the difference here is that the camera now supports a variable aperture between f/1.9 and f/4.0 for different artistic takes.

This will be accompanied by three other Sony IMX858 cameras which include a 12mm ultra-wide unit with autofocusing capability, as well as a pair of 75mm and 120mm zoom lenses which support 3.2x and 5x optical zoom respectively.

Under the hood, the Xiaomi 13 Ultra is powered by the latest Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chipset which will be paired with up to 16GB LPDDR5X RAM and 1TB UFS 4.0 storage in the memory department. Keeping it’s lights on is a respectable 5,000mAh battery with 90W fast wired charging and 50W wireless charging support.

To ensure a more consistent smartphone performance especially when working on resource-intensive tasks like mobile gaming, the phone is equipped with Xiaomi’s in-house Loop LiquidCool technology.

Over on the front side, the Xiaomi 13 Ultra is covered with a 6.73” AMOLED display sporting a sharp QHD+ screen resolution along with a smooth 120Hz adaptive refresh rate. To sweeten up the deal, the display itself also supports native 12-bit color depth, DCI-P3 color gamut coverage, as well as an impressive peak brightness that goes up to 2,600 nits when viewing HDR contents.

The base model of the Xiaomi 13 Ultra is offered in 12GB+256GB configuration while the highest-end model gets you 16GB RAM and 1TB worth of storage. These models are priced at 5,999 Yuan ($870) and 7,299 Yuan ($1,058) respectively in the Chinese market.
