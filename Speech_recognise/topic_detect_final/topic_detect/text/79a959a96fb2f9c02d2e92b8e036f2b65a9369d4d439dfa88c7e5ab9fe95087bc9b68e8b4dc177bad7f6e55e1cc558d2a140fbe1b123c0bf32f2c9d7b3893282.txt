Russell Westbrook is playing his first playoff series with Ty Lue as his head coach. The former NBA MVP was asked what it is like to be coached by him on this stage after Game 2 loss against the Suns.

“He’s very in tune with what’s going on,” Russ said about Lue. “He’s a step ahead always. Always finds ways to put us in a position to be successful.

“I know he always has things going on in his mind and we talk a lot just about adjustments and things we see throughout the game. It’s been great.”
