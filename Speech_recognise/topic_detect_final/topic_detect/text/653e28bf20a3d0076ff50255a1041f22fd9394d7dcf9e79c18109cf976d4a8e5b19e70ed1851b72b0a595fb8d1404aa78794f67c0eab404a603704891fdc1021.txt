Sleep, like love, isn't one size fits all. The comparison may sound like a strange one, but hear us out: Both sleep and love are highly personal and require different things for different people. In the case of love, author and counselor Dr. Gary Chapman devised the five love languages to pinpoint the ways partners prefer to give and receive affection. Now, a similar concept has been applied to sleep.

Sleep psychologist Dr. Shelby Harris, in partnership with relaxation app Calm, created a list of sleep languages that reveals what it takes to get a good night's rest. "Figuring out your main characteristic or what might be the primary thing that gets in the way of you getting good sleep can give you [a clear idea] of what you might want to focus on first in order to improve your sleep," Dr. Harris explained to Well+Good. Just like the five love languages, there are five distinct sleeping types, each requiring unique conditions to achieve sleeping-like-a-baby slumber.
