The automotive industry across the globe is experiencing significant changes such as rise in production of electric vehicles and autonomous vehicles. Many automotive manufacturers have increased their production through the adoption of automation and production plant expansion across the globe. A few of the new manufacturing plants opened in recent years are mentioned below:

In September 2021, Ford announced the opening of its new electric vehicle manufacturing plant in the US with an investment of US$ 11.4 billion.

In September 2022, Continental unveiled its new automotive production plant in Texas with an investment of US$ 110 million.

In October 2021, Nissan announced the opening of its new production plant in Tochigi. The factory is engaged in the manufacturing of next-generation vehicles for attaining carbon neutrality.

The opening of new production plants across the globe is contributing to the rise in vehicle production. CNC milling machines are used widely for automotive production, including the manufacturing of several parts such as interior panels, gearboxes, custom parts, and motors. Thus, the growing automotive production across the globe is driving the demand for CNC milling machines, thereby contributing to the growth of the CNC milling machines market.

Global CNC Milling Machines Market: Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic

The manufacturing sector experienced significant losses due to temporary factory shutdowns and low production volumes, which hindered the growth of the industry across North America. Moreover, the social/physical distancing measures put limitations on the operations of logistics and other service providers. Thus, supply chain disruptions, social distancing norms, and travel restrictions reduced the production of CNC milling machines across the region. According to the BP Statistical Review of World Energy 2020, the US is the world's largest producer and consumer of natural gas. However, the lockdown imposed in the country in mid-2020 due to the COVID-19 outbreak resulted in a considerable decline in oil prices that further restricted the oil & gas industry-related activities, such as storage and transportation of liquid gasses. Due to this, CNC milling machines manufacturing companies faced a decline in demand from the sector across the region. However, the industries started to reopen during the Q3 of 2020, which helped revive the market. Similarly, the automotive, aerospace, and electronics & semiconductor manufacturing also declined in the first two quarters of 2020, further dropping the demand for CNC milling machines. However, the reopening of economies and production plant expansion by the above-mentioned industries influenced the demand for CNC milling machines, thereby contributing to the CNC milling machines market growth.

Global CNC Milling Machines Market: Structure Overview

Based on structure, the CNC milling machines market size is segmented into gantry, moving table, fixed table, and column type. The gantry segment accounted for the largest share in the CNC milling machines market in 2022. The gantry moves along the worktable's longitudinal axis (X-axis), allowing the router to etch out desired patterns on the surface of a milled object. Most gantry can house multiple routers, allowing simultaneous cutting activities on the milled object. The gantry incorporates a motor or similar power system to move and operate the CNC router spindle. The spindle is free to move along the gantry (Y-axis), and the gantry is free to move along the X-axis. Thus, most CNC milling machine has at least two machining axes. Gantry milling machines are one of the most common CNC machine types widely used for various applications across different industry verticals, such as woodworking, aerospace, and automotive. Leading players are constantly developing and launching new gantry mills, owing to the rising competitiveness in the segment. In September 2022, Zimmermann Milling Solutions launched FZ32, FZ37, and FZ42 CNC gantry milling machines. New product launches and the growing demand for CNC milling machines promote the CNC milling machines market for the gantry segment.
