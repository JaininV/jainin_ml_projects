This Tuesday, April 18th, 2023 at 11:00 p.m. ET, you'll have the chance to win $20 million dollars, with a cash option of $10.5 million in Mega Millions.

Each Mega Millions line costs $2. To play, you must choose six numbers from two separate number pools: five different numbers between 1 and 70 (which are drawn with white balls) and one number from 1 to 25 (which is the golden Mega Ball).

You can also select the Easy Pick/Quick Pick. In case you match all six digits, you win the jackpot.

The jackpot is determined according to previous ticket sales and is announced before each drawing.

There are a total of nine ways to win a prize in Mega Millions, ranging from the jackpot to the refund of the purchased ticket. For this, you can include other game alternatives such as Power Play, which increases the cost of the ticket to 3 dollars.

In this option, you choose a ball, which if it wins, multiplies your prize by the number of times it appears in that ball, with a maximum of 10 times. There is also the option to choose different game options, with an additional cost.

If you buy the ticket online the price is higher than when you buy it in a fixed establishment, but it gives you the advantage of participating from anywhere in the world.
