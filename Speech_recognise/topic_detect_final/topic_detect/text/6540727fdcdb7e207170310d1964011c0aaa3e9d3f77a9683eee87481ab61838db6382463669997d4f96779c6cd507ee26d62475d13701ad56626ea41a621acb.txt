A WOMAN was left fuming after popping into her local GAME store to check out their sale discounts.

Ash took to her TikTok page to share a video of her experience in the shop, after going in to see if they had anything she could get as a treat for her son.

"I've just been to GAME because outside on the window it says 'Sale, up to 50% off', and I thought, 'Let's get a little treat, let's see what they've got in the sale'," she said.

"Well, I would recommend you all rushing down to GAME at once because the discounts are unbelievable.

"They're unmatched. Let me show you what I mean."

She kicked off by showing the board game Subway Squeeze, which had been reduced from £14.99 to £14.98.

"What a steal!" she said, sarcastically.

"Throw Throw Avocado," she said of the next game.

"It was £24.99. You can guess it guys, it's £24.98.

"Escape Room: The Game, was £32.99, now £32.98."

"So my question to you GAME is do you think I'm a f**king idiot?" she concluded.

"I know times are hard but what do you think 1p is helping me with?

"Shall I put that towards my gas and electric, shall I? F**k you."

"Thanks a lot GAME, thanks a lot," she captioned the video.

The comments section was quickly filled with people weighing in on the sale, with one writing: "As someone who works for GAME, I don't understand it either but whatever they want."

"I don't think they quite grasped the 'penny sale' concept," another added.

"It must have cost them more to have the new stickers made for 1p off,"  a third commented.

But someone else defended the store, writing: "It does say… UP TO 50% not actually 50% off so actually they lived up to what they said."

GAME has been contacted for comment.
