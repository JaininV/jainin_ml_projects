Police have seized a staggering $6 million worth of cocaine and a huge haul of cash as part of an ongoing investigation into an alleged cross-border crime gang that has already snared a Perth male stripper-turned-DJ.

Earlier this year, The West Australian first reported how Shivan Arasu-Dahl, 32, was among five men charged with a range of offences after a major operation by the drug and firearm squad.
