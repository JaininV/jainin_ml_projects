It happened decades ago…in 1969

When Justice Abe Fortas was forced to resign

He took some questionable fees…worth much more than a tuppence

and the gleeful Republicans successfully sought his comeuppance

They focused public opinion on his questionable behavior

and forced his resignation though  President Johnson tried to be his savior.

Thomas should follow Abe Fortas’ sad example

Because he (Clarence) has chosen to trample

on both implied and accepted judicial ways to behave...

His indiscretions are really quite grave.

Accepting incredible favors and not paying taxes…. good grief!

He’s way worse than a  pickpocket …he’s a significant thief

The public deserves integrity from each high court judge

and if Clarence Thomas is so stubborn and refuses to budge

Throw him out ….We know iIt’s been done before

He doesn’t belong on the court…Demand he be shown the door.
