“Sadly, Apag has nothing new to offer from Mendoza. The “twist” was so predictable just based on the multiple facial reactions from Mercedes Cabral alone. The shaky camera shots really didn’t help as well. It definitely had a lot of potential but was hoping that the murder mystery aspect of this movie was much more exploited. ”
