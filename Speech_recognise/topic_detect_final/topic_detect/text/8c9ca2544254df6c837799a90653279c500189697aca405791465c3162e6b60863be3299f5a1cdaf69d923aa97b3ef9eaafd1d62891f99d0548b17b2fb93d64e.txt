The HEVC encoder/decoder offering includes the HC Series, a high-end UHD HEVC encoder/decoder, suitable for live sporting events and international video transmission.

The HC32000 and HC1x000 feature 4K support, high image quality and ultra low latency @33ms for HD and @100ms for UHD.

In addition, the MV7000 is a compact HEVC HD IP encoder/decoder that offers a variety of functionalities for IP transmission. This inckudes SRT support, high image quality and ultra low latency @33ms for HD.

The Plus Repeater Series of media converter devices that convert electrical signals into optical signals in order to construct an optical transmission network are also on show. Suitable for long-distance content transmission, they offer 100Mbps to 100Gbps bandwidth support and support optical transmission with one fibre.

Finally, the ‘Green’ smart AI chip, which performs object recognition and human pose estimation useful for edge AI cameras and remote production is also available for evaluation. Features include real-time object recognition and pose estimation, low power consumption @1-2W, H.264 Full HD encoding and a compact size at size 12mm x 12mm.
