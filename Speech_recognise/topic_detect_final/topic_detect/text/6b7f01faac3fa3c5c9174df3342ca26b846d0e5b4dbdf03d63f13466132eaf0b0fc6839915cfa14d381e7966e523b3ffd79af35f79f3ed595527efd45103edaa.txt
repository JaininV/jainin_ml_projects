In a statement on social media, Kante thanked the coaching staff and Michigan fans for their interest in him, but said he had decided to request a release from his NLI. He was expected to be a backup at the ‘5' next season, playing a similar role to rising sophomore Tarris Reed Jr.

“First and foremost I want to thank Allah (God) for blessing me every day and making me believe that everything happens or the reason,” Kante wrote in a social media statement. “After a lot of thought and conversations with my family, I have decided to request a release from my NLI to University of Michigan. Thank you to the coaching staff and Michigan fans for their interest in me. Thank you to all my supporters, friends and family for continuing to show love.”

Kante's departure leaves the Wolverines with just one commit in their 2023 class. This coupled with the loss of Hunter Dickinson (he could still come back), Joey Baker, and Kobe Bufkin put Michigan in a tough position for the 2023-24 season.
