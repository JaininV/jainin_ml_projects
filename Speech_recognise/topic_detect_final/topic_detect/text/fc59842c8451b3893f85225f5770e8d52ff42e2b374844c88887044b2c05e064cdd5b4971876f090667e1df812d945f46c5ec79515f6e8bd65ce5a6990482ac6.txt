EPL: Lukaku set to return to Chelsea against his will

Belgium international Romelu Lukaku will be back at Chelsea at the end of the season but it is against his will.

TalkSPORT reports that the striker does not want to return to Stamford Bridge as he would prefer to stay in Italy.

However, Inter Milan do not want to sign him permanently and have decided to let him go back to his parent club.

Lukaku returned to the Italian Serie A side on loan this season but has not been the player who previously led them to the title the previous season, having managed just seven goals in 24 games.

He has struggled with injury this season.

Gazzetta dello Sport claims Inter cannot afford to buy the former Manchester United and Everton player on a full-term deal. Hence he will go back to west London at the end of the season.
