Darren McGrady, once the head chef for the Queen of England, has launched a food truck in Vancouver, Washington.

The truck is called Winston's British Fish N Chips, according to a KGW8 report.

The cart has fast become popular since debuting in March with foodies waiting in line before it opens at 2711 Northeast Andresen Road, near the Vancouver Mall. It was co-founded with Timothy Johnson.

"I wanted the fish and chips to be as good as when they are passed through that window, for 40 minutes, to allow people to get to the office, to get home, to get to school, to get to the hospital, wherever they were going to go with them and they'd still be nice and crunchy," McGrady told the news outlet.

McGrady is planning to launch his second truck this spring in Dallas, Texas.
