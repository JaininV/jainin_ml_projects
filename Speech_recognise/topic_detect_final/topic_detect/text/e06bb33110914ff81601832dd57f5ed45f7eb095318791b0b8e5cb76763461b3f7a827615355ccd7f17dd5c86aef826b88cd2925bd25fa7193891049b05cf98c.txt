From the cover: Graham Ovenden is a natural born artist of acute originality and grace, in the words of Laurie Lee, who has captured regions and perceptions unmistakably his own. Best known for his paintings and drawings, Graham Ovenden is also a well-rounded artist in the Renaissance manner, practising in turn the disciplines of photography, music, poetry, design, and architecture. In the collection of work shown here the whole sweep of the artists output during the last thirty years may be seen, from his photographic studies of children in the East End in the 1950s to his most recent nudes and landscapes and the continuing creation of his own home, Barley Splatt, in Cornwall.
