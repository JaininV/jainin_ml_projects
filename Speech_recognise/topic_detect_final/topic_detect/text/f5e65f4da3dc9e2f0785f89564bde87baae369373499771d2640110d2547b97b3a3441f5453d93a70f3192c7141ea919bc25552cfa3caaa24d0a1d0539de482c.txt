After an intensive search facilitated by Haisla Nation Council (HNC), Poole Consulting Ltd., and Scout Talent, Haisla Nation elected Chief & Council have appointed a Chief Administrative Officer (CAO).

We are pleased to announce that Laurie Mercer will join Haisla Nation Council as the new Chief Administrative Officer.  Laurie will report directly to elected Chief and Council, with her first day being April 17, 2023.

Laurie comes to us with more than 15 years of experience.  She has worked with Indigenous government in numerous management-level capacities. Her background includes financial management, infrastructure and life cycle management, and implementation of community plans.

There will be a transition period as she acclimates to the organization as elected Council and the Deputy CAOs bring her up to date on organizational and community matters. In the coming weeks Laurie will be introduced to staff, membership, committees, industry, and political affiliates.

Please join us in welcoming Laurie to our community.
