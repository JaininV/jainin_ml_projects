It wasn’t long after the latest trailer for The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom that I began searching YouTube in hopes to find that someone had uploaded the new music. Fans were quick to do so, though it seemed like each file still had some remnant of the non-musical sound effects in the trailer. Sure enough, gaming musician Tim de Man was quick to the rescue and wasted no time in pumping out his piano arrangement of the trailer music.

Tim de Man has other Zelda piano arrangements as well, such as the extended version of the Tears of the Kingdom Main Theme from the March 28th gameplay demonstration. If you’re a fan of Zelda music, or video game music in general, I highly suggest checking out this creator’s channel. In addition to a plethora of Zelda arrangements, Tim de Man’s music catalog features pieces from Mario and Final Fantasy, among other gaming and non-gaming franchises alike. It’s always wonderful to see fans produce their own covers of new music with such speed.
