After making some devastating cuts to the guest list, deciding which friend is your best friend who also happens to be comfortable with public speaking and being in charge of a team of unpaid planning employees is tough.

Still, accepting rejection gracefully and showing up to the wedding with a smile and a blender is normal wedding etiquette. So, when a frustrated bride decided to vent to the hilarious judgmental "Wedding Shaming" group of Reddit about a friend who wasn't even in the running for MOH, people were ready for the gossip.

Right after I got engaged one friend (we’ll call her Linda) congratulated us on FB and commented that she couldn’t wait to be my MOH. I have no idea why she assumed she would be MOH. We had previously been very close, but I had moved several years earlier and we naturally drifted.
