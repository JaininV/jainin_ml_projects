As Natalie Cassidy counts down to the London Marathon this weekend, the actress has shared a photo of herself proudly in her running gear – but all of our attention was firmly on her jaw-dropping doorway!

Her double-fronted entranceway with large wooden doors with glass panels are striking enough on their own, but to add to the beautiful welcome Natalie has had a company add wisteria to the top of the door frame, creating an incredible country home feel.

The incredible front door display did not go unnoticed by fans with one writing, "Literally the most beautiful door I've ever seen in my life," and another adding: "That wisteria is beautiful." A third wrote: "Your door looks fabulous."

Many of the other comments wished Natalie luck on her run this weekend, sending virtual well wishes and big cheers. With lots saying that her training updates have kept them going on their own running journeys.

Natalie captioned the snap: "IT IS MARATHON WEEK!!!! Nervous, excited, tired, happy and very, very grateful to every single one of you for donating to @babsarmy’s page. You guys are amazing. We will do you proud. Also thought I’d say thank you to me lovely friends @thedoordisplaycompany for my spring/summer door. Every time I get home it makes me smile. Have a great week all."

The actress lives in Hertfordshire and each season she uses the same company to transform the exterior of her house. In the past, Natalie has had wreaths and bauble displays at Christmas, for example. Come Autumn-time, she had a mix of orange, yellow and red leaves lining the door – ideal for the season.

Door displays are becoming more and more popular with celebrities and the public alike, with many copying stars like Stacey Solomon, Mrs Hinch and Amanda Holden who all elevate their entrances with displays at various times of the year.
