Aziz Ansari is set to make his feature directorial debut with Good Fortune, a comedy from Lionsgate. Ansari will also write and star in the live-action comedy alongside Seth Rogen and Keanu Reeves.

According to Variety, the production has been greenlit and will start principal photography next month in Los Angeles with Lionsgate launching sales in Cannes Film Festival. “We have indeed found good fortune with this film. We love the script and believe strongly in Aziz as both a performer and a director,” said Lionsgate’s Joe Drake.

“And when you add in Seth and Keanu — two incredible world-class talents — top-lining alongside Aziz, this has the potential to be a very special film for us. We moved quickly to land this project once it was available,” he added. Good Fortune marks Ansari's second attempt at making his directorial debut.

Previously, he was working on Searchlight’s comedic drama Being Mortal, but the project was indefinitely suspended following the news of actor Bill Murray's inappropriate behavior on set. At the time, Murray commented on the incident by saying, “I did something I thought was funny and it wasn’t taken that way.

“The movie studio wanted to do the right thing, so they wanted to check it all out and investigate it and so they stopped the production.” The project was officially scrapped earlier this year. Meanwhile, Good Fortune will be produced by Anthony Katagas, Alan Yang and Ansari.
