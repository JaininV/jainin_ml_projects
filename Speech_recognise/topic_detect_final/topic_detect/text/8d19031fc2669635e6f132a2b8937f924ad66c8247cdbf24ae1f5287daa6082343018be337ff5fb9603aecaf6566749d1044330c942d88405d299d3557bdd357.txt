Not long ago, Nike Sportswear introduced a new model of the Air Force 1 known as the Air Force 1 High Sculpt, which is a women’s exclusive. So far, the pairs have mostly launched in OG-like color blocking and keeping things simple and clean. The standout feature of this model is the lack of an ankle strap, which goes back to the model’s roots of being worn on basketball courts. For our next pair to share, we have the ‘Rush Fuchsia’ iteration that will debut in Spring 2023.

This variation of the Nike Air Force 1 High comes dressed in a Pale Ivory, Rush Fuchsia, and Violet Dust color combination. As mentioned, the shoes come with a strap-less build with Pale Ivory tumbled leather on the upper. Next, Fuchsia fills in the cut-out Swooshes on the panels, while Violet Dust adorns the terry cloth liner, suede heel overlays, and rubber outsole. Finishing the look is Off White on the leather tongue labels, laces, and midsole.

You can expect the Nike Air Force 1 High Sculpt ‘Rush Fuchsia’ to release later this year at select retailers and Nike.com in women’s sizing. The retail price is $135. Once we have more information, we will make sure to update you. For now, scroll below for more photos giving you a closer look.
