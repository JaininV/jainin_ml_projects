Popular actor Deyemi Okanlawon has advised his colleague, Kunle Remi after he was snubbed by the Africa Magic Viewers’ Choice Awards, AMVCA organisers, to seek spiritual means.

Recall that actor Kunle Afolayan’s 2022 movie, Anikulapo, received the highest number of nominations at the 2023 edition of Africa Magic Viewers’ Choice Awards.

Even though the movie was nominated in 15 different categories with 16 nominations, Anikulapo lead actor Kunle Remi didn’t get one nomination.

Speaking on his exclusion from the AMVCA 2023 nomination list on his Instagram page, Remi stated that he would have won the categories some of his friends were nominated for if he were nominated.

He said, “First of all, congratulations to all my friends/colleagues. This year won’t be great without y’all’s amazing work and effort. God save una, because I would have won if I’m in the category.”

Advising the Anikulapo star in a post on his Instagram page, Okanlawon urged Remi not to give up. And further encouraged him to seek spiritual means.

Okanlawon said, “In life, if all else fails, be like KR and try any spiritual means possible. one must work. Take heart, @kunleremiofficial. Your TTVCA (TikTok Viewers Choice Awards) nomination will come soon IJN.

“Please, let’s come together and send KR love and small change to console him in this trying time, but you can send your special gifts for my birthday tomorrow.”
