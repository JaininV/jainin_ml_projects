For the past nearly 10 years, the federal government has been targeting and harassing a Washington, D. C.-area Amish farm for elimination.

Miller’s Organic Farm, as it is called, has been in the crosshairs of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) since 2015 when an investigation was first launched into the food club’s activities.

The farm allows members to pay a small fee for access to clean and nutritious foods that are not processed at a USDA meat or dairy facility, as this is not necessary under food club status. The USDA is upset about this, naturally, and has been looking for ways to shut down the farm for many years now.

Miller produces and sells all kinds of health foods ranging from meat to dairy to eggs. Club members can purchase these items directly, which is upsetting to the USDA because it wants people to have to purchase only foods that go through the USDA processing regimen.

The U. S. government is a force of relentless evil in the world

Miller’s farm has been raided again and again by the feds, and he has been falsely accused of selling tainted raw milk and other products to customers. The government is demanding access to all of his food records dating back to 2012, but Miller is refusing, citing contractual requirements for keeping this information private.
