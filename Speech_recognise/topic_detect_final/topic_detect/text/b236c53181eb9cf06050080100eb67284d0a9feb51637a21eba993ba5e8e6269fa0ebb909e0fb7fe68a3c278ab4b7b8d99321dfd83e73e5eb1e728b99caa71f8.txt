Police shot and arrested a 39-year-old Long Beach man on Sunday after he was suspected in four shootings in Downtown that left one man injured, according to authorities.

Esmundo Chavarin was arrested and booked for attempted murder, possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and violation of parole, arrest records show.

The arrest took place at 4:52 p.m. at the intersection of Ocean Boulevard and Elm Avenue shortly after Chavarin allegedly shot at police, who were in the area searching for a man that matched his description after four shootings were reported nearby between 1 p.m. and 4:46 p.m.

An officer shot Chavarin, striking him in the upper body, but his injury was not considered to be life-threatening, police said.

Chavarin was transported to a local hospital by the Long Beach Fire Department, and a firearm was recovered at the scene. No officers were injured, according to authorities.

The shootings shut down Ocean Boulevard from Pacific Avenue to Alamitos Avenue at approximately 4:56 p.m., just as the Acura Grand Prix of Long Beach was ending.

Jim Michaelian, president and CEO of the Grand Prix Association of Long Beach, said the incidents had “a minimal impact on various egress routes” from the event.

Officers assigned to the event closed the gate at Long Beach and Ocean boulevards and assisted with traffic control as attendees exited, according to LBPD spokesperson Brandon Fahey.

At approximately 7 p.m., Ocean Boulevard from Pacific Avenue to Pine Avenue was reopened, and about an hour later, at 8 p.m., Ocean Boulevard to Long Beach Boulevard was reopened, Fahey said. All closures reopened at roughly 10:30 pm.

Chavarin is now being held in jail in lieu of $1 million bail, arrest records show.
