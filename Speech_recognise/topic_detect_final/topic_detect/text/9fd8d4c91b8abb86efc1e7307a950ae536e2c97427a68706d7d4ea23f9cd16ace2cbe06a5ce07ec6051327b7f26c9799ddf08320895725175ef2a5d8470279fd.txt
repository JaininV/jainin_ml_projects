The New York Mets will begin wearing an advertisement for NewYork-Presbyterian, a non-profit academic medical centre, on their jersey sleeves for their home opener on Friday. The patch will then continue to be worn for the remainder of the season.

The advertisement shows the NewYork-Presbyterian logo in red on an obnoxiously large white square trimmed in red.

Here’s an actual photo of the patch on the jersey to give you a good idea of the size:

“The Mets have always believed that baseball’s impact can extend off the field and into the local community. This philosophy drives us to partner with organizations that can meaningfully engage and uplift the Greater New York area,” said Jeff Deline, Executive Vice President, Chief Revenue Officer of the Mets, in the press release. “We’re proud to partner with NewYork-Presbyterian to offer new health and wellness initiatives for the communities, patients, and healthcare workers who are the heartbeat of the city.”

The deal extends beyond the jersey advertisement patch. Fans who deliver their babies at NewYork-Presbyterian hospitals will get a Mets-branded onesie; the two organizations will work together to host various health-related events, such as cancer screenings and blood drives; the 7th-inning stretch will be branded and focused on promoting an active lifestyle, and NewYork-Presbyterian patients and healthcare workers will be recognized on the field during designated games.
