Yamaha Motor India has launched the 2023 Yamaha Aerox 155 maxi-scooter at Rs 1.43 lakh (ex-showroom, India) and the latest iteration of the maxi-scooter now sports Traction Control (TC).

Other than that, the newly launched 2023 Yamaha Aerox 155 maxi-scooter now comes with RDE and BS6 Phase 2

compatible engine. Other changes in the powertrain include a

new OBD 2

port.

That being said, the Yamaha Aerox 155 maxi-scooter continues to be powered by a

155cc, single-cylinder, fuel-injected engine with Variable Valve Actuation (VVA). This engine produces 14.8bhp of peak power at 8,000rpm, whereas peak torque output stands at 13.9Nm at 6,500rpm.

Coming to the features, the Yamaha Aerox 155 maxi-scooter comes with features such as single-channel ABS, 14-inch wheels, a

wide 140mm rear tyre, a

5.8-inch LCD instrument cluster, LED headlights, LED taillights, a

start &

stop system, an external fuel lid and more.

In addition to that, the Yamaha Aerox 155 maxi-scooter also comes with Bluetooth connectivity through which users can track vital information such as maintenance recommendations, last parked location, fuel consumption, malfunction notification, and more via a

dedicated application.

Though the Yamaha Aerox 155 is a

sporty scooter, it is actually quite spacious and comes with a

very practical 24.5-litre underseat storage. In addition to that, the Yamaha Aerox 155 also comes with a

power socket at the front to charge electronic devices.

Apart from that, the 2023 Yamaha Aerox 155 maxi-scooter comes with telescopic front suspension at the front and twin gas-charged shock absorbers at the rear. On the other hand, braking duties are carried out by a

230mm disc at the front and a

130mm drum at the rear.

With the addition of Traction Control (TC), the Yamaha Aerox 155 maxi-scooter has become a

lot safer. Moreover, we expect this new safety feature to be very helpful to new riders especially when it is raining.
