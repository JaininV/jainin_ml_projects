Fort Worth, Texas (April 10, 2023) – XS® Sights, makers of the fastest sights in any light and the tools needed to install them, will display its newest products for personal defense and hunting at the 2023 NRA Annual Meetings and Exhibits in Indianapolis, Indiana, April 14-16.  Attendees are encouraged to stop by the XS Sights Booth (# 4621) to meet the team and try XS’ laser shot simulator to experience the increased speed and accuracy of shooting with DXT2 Big Dot and R3D night sights.  Designed for personal defense, XS’s proprietary Glow Dot technology surrounding the tritium vial in these front sights provides dual illumination and unsurpassed front sight visibility in all light conditions.

New standard dot sights, with green or orange front sight, for the Taurus 856 revolver and new R3D sights (green or orange) for the Kimber K6 will be on display along with many other night sights designed for personal defense.  XS will also showcase its new Inline Rear Sight Pusher Tools for Glock pistols – a DIY version and a Gunsmith model – in addition to new lever rail and ghost ring sights for Henry Big Boy Carbines.

“We are excited to meet with NRA members, show them our newest products and, if they are looking to upgrade their factory sights, help them find the sight-style that best works with their eyes,” said Addison Monroe, Marketing Manager, XS Sights. “Our products are designed to enhance firearm owners’ shooting experience by offering improved sight visibility, speed, and accuracy.”

All XS Sights are backed by a 10-year, No Questions Asked Warranty and XS’s 30-Day Satisfaction Guarantee.
