A Nigerian lady has opened up on why controversial relationship coach Blessing CEO is still locked up even after she was granted bail of N10 million naira.

According to Queen Rita, the reason is because Blessing CEO has not met all the conditions listed in her bail.

Recall that Blessing Okoro was remanded in prison on the 1st of April over alleged cyber-bullying of Folashade Samuels, the sister of late Bimbo Ogbonna, wife to business mogul, IVD.

It is over two weeks, she's still in prison.

Queen Rita took to social media to share some of the bail conditions that would need to be fulfilled if sheâ€™s to be granted bail.

According to Queen Rita, aside from the 10 million naira bail, Blessing CEO is required to provide two sureties who also have 10 million naira in their accounts.

These two sureties must be influential people who have houses in highbrow areas in Lagos like Lekki, Banana Island, Ikoyi etc.

She also revealed that the sureties would have to submit their statement of account as well as their international passports for inspection.
