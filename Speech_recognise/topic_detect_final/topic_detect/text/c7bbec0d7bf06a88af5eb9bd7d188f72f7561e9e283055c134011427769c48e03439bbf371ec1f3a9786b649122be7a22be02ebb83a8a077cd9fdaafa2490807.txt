The teams are officially in for the Round 5 Gather Round opener between Adelaide and Carlton.

The Blues were forced into one change with Sam Docherty sidelined but brought in the likes of Sam Walsh for his first game of the season alongside Blake Acres and Matt Kennedy

As for Adelaide, Darcy Fogarty and Luke Pedlar return from injury and suspension respectively.

SEN Sportsday’s Gerard Healy, Brad Johnson and Kane Cornes reacted to the teams being released on Wednesday night.

Cornes: “There’s some big changes, for Adelaide, Fogarty and Pedlar come back in.

“(Ned) McHenry got coaches votes (last week) but he’s been dropped, I suspect he’ll be the sub and (Lachlan) Gollant is stiff, he’s been in good form.

“Carlton have three big ones, Walsh, Acres and Kennedy are in for (Lochie) O’Brien and (Josh) Honey who are both omitted and Docherty is injured

Healy: “My initial thoughts are McHenry is about the stiffest bloke in Australia right now.”

Johnson: “How do you go from coaches votes to the sub?”

Healy: “I’m not sure Pedlar deserves his spot ahead of McHenry, I know he’s a highly-rated young kid, but McHenry last week was absolutely superb.

“They have got some selection pressure which is testament that they’re a darn good side now.”

Johnson: “Three midfielders come in for Carlton with Walsh, Acres and Kennedy – you can add what Walsh will do first up, he won’t miss a beat.

“Acres on a wing I think is critical … and throw Kennedy in around the ball and up forward.”

Johnson: “They are extremely good ins … three experienced players coming in compared to what they lose.”
