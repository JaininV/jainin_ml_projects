If your name’s Chris, and someone else is also Chris, that’s not a problem. If your name’s Chris Smith, and someone else is also Chris Smith, that’s not a problem either. But sometimes, we formally say a name belongs to just one entity, which is why if you try getting the username “ChrisSmith” anywhere, you’ll see that someone’s already got it. They beat you to it, fair and square.

Problem is, sometimes, the eventual owner of the name may well not be whoever had it first.

Charles Goodyear invented vulcanized rubber. Liquid latex comes dripping out of the rubber tree, but Goodyear figured out how to make it into a strong material that won’t go all melty on you. His method of heating rubber led to the rubber tires we all know and love, as well as to latex condoms, which he invented. His rubber now rules the world. You’ll know that if you ever see his name on an airship run by the firm Goodyear Tires, an airship that would look quite terrifying if not for the cheerful Goodyear floors and logo.  Side note: There are no more Goodyear blimps, only airships. The difference is rigidity. Also, all this talk of “rigidity” and “firm” and “things going melty” is probably why Goodyear’s mind went so quickly to condoms. But Goodyear Tires (or the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, to use its full name) was never Charles Goodyear’s outfit. They just named themselves after him. Goodyear the company is hugely successful, worth many billions, but Charles Goodyear died poor, having spent his whole life failing at business and struggling to protect his patents.
