Sweep me up

with the dust on the floor,

my broken bones,

the dirt, the shards of glass.

Bury it all in a cardboard box,

swaddled in old newsprint

and hope

that in the small hours, you do not hear

clank-crash-smash

from the midden, on the move,

seekingâ€”like the mirror,

like the shadows, like I did.
