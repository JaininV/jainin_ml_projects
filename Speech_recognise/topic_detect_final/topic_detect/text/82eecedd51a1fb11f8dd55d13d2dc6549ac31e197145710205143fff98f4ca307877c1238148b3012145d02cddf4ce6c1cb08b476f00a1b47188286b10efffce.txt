Tao was a frightened orphan who came to us three years ago after his mother was killed for bushmeat. Today, he is finally back in the wild, where he belongs.

Like Tao, most of the troop was rescued from bushmeat hunters or the illegal pet trade and have made amazing progress in their rehabilitation. It’s amazing to see them take their first steps in their new life in Kasungu National Park.

We’ll continue to monitor the troop for a week or two – just to make sure they’ve settled in well to their new home. By releasing them in the wet season – with plenty of water and food – we’re giving them the best possible start to their life in the wild.

Huge thanks to everyone who helped us get these monkeys this far – to our partners the Department of National Parks and Wildlife, and to everyone who donated to give Tao and his new family a second chance at freedom, including the International Primate Protection League.
