Erotic watches have been around for centuries, but rarely are these "conversation pieces" worn in plain view. Perrelet's Turbine Erotic manages to make them acceptable for daily wear with a 12-blade dial that only spins with wrist movement. When stationary, it obscures the subdial beneath, while vigorous movement causes it to spin fast enough to reveal the Japanese Hentai-inspired erotic scene underneath. Two variations are available, one depicting an animalistic act, and the second featuring a female character enjoying solo play. Both are powered by a COSC certified P-331-MH in-house automatic movement and feature 44mm stainless steel cases set on a bi-material black rubber and leather strap. Limited to 50 examples each.
