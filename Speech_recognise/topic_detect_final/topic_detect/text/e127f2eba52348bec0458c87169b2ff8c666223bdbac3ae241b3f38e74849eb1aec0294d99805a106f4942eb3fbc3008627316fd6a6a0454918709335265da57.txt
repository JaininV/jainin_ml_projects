Liam Gallagher has shared his thoughts on a "lost" Oasis album generated by AI that has recently gone viral.

Made by UK band Breezer, the album imagines what it would sound like if Oasis were to reform and release a new album in 2023. It features Breezer’s original tracks but replaces the singer’s vocals with an AI-generated version of  Gallagher’s.

The album, titled ‘AISIS’, has already gathered tens of thousands of views in less than a week and has received lots of positive response from Oasis fans on social media.

Since dropping, 'AISIS' has also caught the attention of Oasis frontman Liam Gallagher, who applauded the album for being "better than all the other snizzle out there".

He told one follower on Twitter that he found the project “Mad as fuck”, claiming “I sound mega”.
