RoboForex, a leading global provider of financial services, is now enabling experienced Traders who use the CopyFX service for copy trading on its multi-asset trading platform R StocksTrader to set Performance fees on trades copied by Investors. The Performance fees paid by the Investor to the Trader are subject to profitable trades.

RoboForex launched the CopyFX copy trading service for users of the mobile version of its multi-asset trading platform R StocksTrader at the end of 2022.  At launch time, Traders could test the service, acquire their investment rating, and take their place on the list of top-rated traders. By now, CopyFX Traders, as the strategy providers, can charge performance fees from its Investors for the successful copy trading.

This novelty will allow Traders not only to make a profit on their own trades, but also receive added income in the form of Performance fee for their positions copied by Investors who are following them. It should be noted that the Investor pays the fee only if the trade turns out profitable. Read more about the Performance fee scheme in this article.

CopyFX is meant for Investors to benefit from the expertise of more experienced Traders by subscribing to the said Traders’ strategies, and thereby make a profit by copying their successful trades. Traders can, in their turn, benefit by receiving Performance fees from Investors who have used their successful strategies.
