SOUTH KOREA — Nicolas Ghesquière’s first pre-fall runway show for Louis Vuitton will take place on a bridge over storied waters in Seoul, South Korea on April 29.

The show will unfold after sunset on the Jamsugyo Bridge that spans the Hangang River — and with Squid Game director Hwang Dong-hyuk acting as a creative adviser on the show scenography.

This runway presentation marks the first time the double-decker bridge will host a fashion show, and kicks off a series of initiatives between the luxury goods giant and local and national governments to promote Korea and exalt the waterway, one of the most beloved and scenic elements of Seoul and a lifeblood for millions of South Koreans.

It also represents one of the first splashy initiatives of new Louis Vuitton chairman and chief executive officer Pietro Beccari, who made spectacular fashion events in impressive locales a hallmark of his tenure at Christian Dior. He started at Vuitton on Feb. 1, and brought Ghesquière on board to add a new itinerant runway show to Vuitton’s playbook.

Beccari called Seoul a “cultural hub that continues to draw global attention” and a cosmopolitan city that “shares a common spirit with Louis Vuitton for pioneering the future, reimagining creativity and nurturing savoir faire.”

Disclosing details of the runway showcase exclusively with WWD, Louis Vuitton billed the event as global in reach, yet inclusive, engaging local talents and communities.

The brand characterized Ghesquière’s collaboration with Hwang as being “in the spirit of creative collaboration” dear to the fashion designer, and reflecting “the will of Louis Vuitton to highlight and showcase local culture and artistic excellence on a global scale.”

The LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton – owed brand’s pre-fall show will be livestreamed on its social channels and on outdoor screens across Seoul. In addition, the brand plans to invite 100 local fashion students to be among the 1,600 guests.
