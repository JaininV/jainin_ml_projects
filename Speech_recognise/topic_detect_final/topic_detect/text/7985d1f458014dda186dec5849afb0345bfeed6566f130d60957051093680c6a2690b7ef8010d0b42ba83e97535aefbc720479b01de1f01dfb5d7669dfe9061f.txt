This week the Senate is considering S. 870, the Fire Grants and Safety Act. This bill would reauthorize the U. S. Fire Administration (USFA), Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response (SAFER), and Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) programs. The authorizations for these programs are scheduled to end in September.

It is important that your Senators hear from you regarding the need to pass this bill. Over the past couple of weeks, the NVFC has sent out a Legislative Action Alert requesting our members to contact their Senators. If you have not done so already, click here to urge your Senators to support clean passage of S. 870 when it is considered on the Senate floor this week.
