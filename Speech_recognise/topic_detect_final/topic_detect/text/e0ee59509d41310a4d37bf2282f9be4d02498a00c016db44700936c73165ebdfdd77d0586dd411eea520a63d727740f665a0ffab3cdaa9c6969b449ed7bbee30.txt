Defence Council says keeping up support for Ukraine, critical

Romania's Supreme Council for National Defence (CSAT) on Tuesday discussed the security situation in the Black Sea region.

According to the Presidential Administration, the agenda of the meeting led by President Klaus Iohannis focused mainly on the security situation in the Black Sea region and the implications for Romania amidst Russia's ongoing aggression against Ukraine, external interference with the democratic process in Moldova, as well as the prospects for NATO, the European Union and the world community continuing their support for Ukraine.

"Romania continues to act firmly, unitedly and efficiently, together with its allies and partners, in promoting security and stability in the Black Sea region, an area of strategic importance to Euro-Atlantic security. The fundamental benchmark of action remains that of ensuring national security, and supporting Ukraine and the Republic of Moldova contributes directly to strengthening Romania's security."

In view of the NATO Summit in Vilnius scheduled for July, CSAT ensured that the processes of implementing the historic measures adopted in Madrid in 2022 regarding the long-term strengthening of NATO's deterrence and defence posture on the eastern flank and in the Black Sea, which are ongoing, will be fully finalised.

"At the same time, keeping up a consistent and multidimensional support for Ukraine, within NATO and the European Union, is of critical importance to ensure the success of the country's defence efforts, both now and in the long term. CSAT also agreed that Romania's effort must continue to be a comprehensive one to secure the necessary support for the other vulnerable partners in the region -- first of all the Republic of Moldova -- which, after Ukraine, is the most exposed to Russian aggression and pressure."

CSAT reportedly emphasised the "professional, democratic and responsible" way Moldova has been managing the hybrid actions of destabilisation, of unprecedented intensity and complexity.

"Since the outbreak of the war on our borders, the Republic of Moldova has been under pressure on multiple levels, with the aim of diminishing the support expressed by its citizens for a firm pro-European course, for reforms, for democracy and prosperity. Given the circumstances, the optimal ways of Romania continuing its staunch support for the efforts of the Republic of Moldova to strengthen its resilience were analysed. The council underscored the need to adapt to regional developments and to further strengthen the support measures at the European level and internationally to the benefit of the Republic of Moldova."
