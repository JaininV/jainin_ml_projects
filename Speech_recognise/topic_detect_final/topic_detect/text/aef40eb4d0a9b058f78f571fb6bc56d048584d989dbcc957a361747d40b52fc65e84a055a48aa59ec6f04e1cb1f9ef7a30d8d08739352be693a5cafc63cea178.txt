There is a new Swagbucks Swag Code available from 3 pm until 5 pm ET on April 17, 2023. Scroll down for your unique Swag Code.

Once you see the code, copy it and enter it in the Swag Code box on the Homepage (when you click on your name in the top right corner, look for Redeem Swag Code and enter it there) or on the Swagbucks Mobile App or on the SwagButton (that you download on your computer).

* Search online: Each time you need to search for something online, use the Swagbucks search engine on their website (instead of Google). I actually have the Swagbucks toolbar installed on my desktop and it places a search box right on my screen making it super easy to search. Every once in a while, they award SB points just for doing the searches I used to do using Google.

* Take surveys on their website

* Watch videos through their website or multiple mobile apps

* Enter the regular Swag Codes: Swagbucks posts bonus codes on their Facebook page. Once you get the code, you then copy and paste the code into the Swagbucks Mobile App, their website or in the Swagbutton (that you can download to your computer).
