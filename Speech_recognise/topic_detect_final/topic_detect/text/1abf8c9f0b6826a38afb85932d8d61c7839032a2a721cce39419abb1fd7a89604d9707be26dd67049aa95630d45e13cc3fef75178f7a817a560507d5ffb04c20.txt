Following its inaugural collaboration back in 2021, NEEDLES and MIYAGIHIDETAKA have now reconnected for another capsule collection. The special Spring 2023 range builds on the 7 Cuts Wide Shirt and Ribbon Wide Shirt found in the first collaboration, developing an expansive collection of mashup styles built on designer Keizo Shimizu‘s signature designs.

Aside from new takes on the 7 Cuts Wide Shirt and Ribbon Wide Shirt, the striking button-ups are also rendered in tie-dye outlooks for a unique aesthetic. Other standouts include the Track Jacket and Boot-Cut Track pant set centered around bandana prints and accented by varied side taping. Rounding up the collaboration is the Covered Reversible Jacket and Zipped Mohair Jacket which continues the Rebuild by NEEDLES design outlook and retro styling of the NEEDLES label.

Priced between ¥29,700 and ¥66,000 (approximately $222 and $493 USD), the MIYAGIHIDETAKA x NEEDLES Spring 2023 capsule collection will be available April 15 exclusively via NEPENTHES, MIYAGIHIDETAKA, and IMA:ZINE.

For more contemporary fashion, Jakob Hetzer and XLIM come together for a conversation with “JHXLIM.”
