US Open Polo Championship: Valiente and MAG qualified to quarter finals

Valiente and MAG joined Scone, Park Place and Dazos in the quarter finals of the US Open Polo Championship, following their wins against Dutta Corp Show+ and Palm Beach Equine, respectively, on Monday April 10. The most prestigious polo competition in the United States and the highlight of The Gauntlet of Polo, the US Open Polo Championship is being played at the USPA-owned National Polo Center Wellington, in Wellington, Florida. The culminating contest of the polo season in the United States sees thirteen teams up to 22 goals, split in five leagues, in participation.

Valiente beat Dutta Corp Show+ 11-7, in a match that had two very different halves – the first was very leveled and the second, was dominated by Bob Jornayvaz’s lineup. Up next, MAG had no trouble at all to defeat Palm Beach Equine 15-9.

The remaining three teams to step into the tournament’s next phase, will be revealed on Tuesday April 11, after the three last league games:
