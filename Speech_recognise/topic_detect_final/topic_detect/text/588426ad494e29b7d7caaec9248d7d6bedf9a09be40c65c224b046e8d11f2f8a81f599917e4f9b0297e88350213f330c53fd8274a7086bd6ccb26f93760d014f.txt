The vast majority of racial crime in the United States is intra-racial. But when it does come to interracial homicide, for example, the chances that a white person killed was killed by a black person are far higher than that a black person killed was killed by a white person. pic.twitter.com/SFIuzq0LPw

The media routinely refuse to report even the race of suspects when the suspect is black and the victim is white. Ignoring crime because the suspect is black, by the way, actually promotes crime against black people, since as stated, most crime is intra-racial.

This is from the Bureau of Justice Statistics. There were, in 2019, 562,550 violent interracial black/white incidents. 472,570 (84%) of them were black on white. pic.twitter.com/TGt1nsi99Y
