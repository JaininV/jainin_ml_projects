The New Zealand Warriors’ hot run of form has extended to five wins from seven matches after their 22-14 home victory over the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night.

In front of a packed-out Mt Smart Stadium, the new-look Warriors side proved their Round 2 win over the Cowboys was no fluke, holding the visitors to just three tries across the game.

Tries to Addin Fonua-Blake, Edward Kosi, Josh Curran and Dylan Walker put Andrew Webster’s side in the box seat, while the return of skipper Tohu Harris made a visible difference at both ends of the field.

Now with a record of 5-2 to start the season and sitting third on the ladder, former coach and SENZ commentator Tony Kemp has questioned whether the Warriors will be a Top 4 side at the end of the regular season.

“When you’re asking, ‘Do you think the Warriors can make the four,’ look, they sit top of the ladder currently with the Broncos,” Kemp told SENZ.

“They’ve got five weeks (coming up); one with a bye, four decent games to go and the way that they’re playing, if we get teams that are showing up (out of form, we can win).

“You saw the Roosters show up (on Friday), they weren’t up to it,

“If they do that here against the Warriors’ side with 23,000 people following them, they’ll turn them over.”

Fellow commentator Sam Hewat agreed with Kemp’s sentiments, saying the Warriors’ niche in 2023 may be striking teams who aren’t on their game.

“That’s what I think (former NRL players) Matty Johns and (Immortal) Joey Johns have talked about, is the Warriors are going to be that team (that) if you’re not at 100 per cent, they will be the team that can trip you up,” Hewat added.

“Maybe that’s their niche for 2023 and I think no one expected 2023 to be such a turnaround season.

“People were talking about this 5–10-year plan, in a way it’s almost a success already with the way that they have played.

“Of course we want them to keep going and we want them to make the Top 8 etc but you’ve almost got to give it a pass mark just for how they’ve turned things around from 2022.”

While the early success has been a welcome start for the Warriors, the next block of matches will see them take on the Melbourne Storm, Sydney Roosters and Penrith Panthers all within three weeks.

They will face the Storm for the traditional ANZAC clash on April 25 at AAMI Park.
