Miranda Kerr is preparing to celebrate her milestone 40th birthday.

But the former Victoria's Secret model could have passed for a woman half her age on Saturday as she graced the  Breakthrough Prize red carpet in Los Angeles.

Joined by her husband, Snapchat billionaire Evan Spiegel, the Australian beauty oozed Old Hollywood glamour as she posed in a strapless black gown with a sweetheart neckline.

Miranda paired her figure-hugging gown with a diamond necklace and matching earrings.

The KORA organics founder wore her brunette tresses up in an elegant chignon and topped off her look with bright red lipstick.

Tech entrepreneur Evan meanwhile looked dapper in a black suit and matching bow tie.

Miranda has previously said that she eats extremely clean food and stays healthy to maintain her trim figure.

'The first step is eating healthy. I predominantly eat organic when I can. I eat extremely healthy because when I do, I have more energy,' she said.

She added to E Online: 'I'm pretty much 80 percent healthy, 20 percent indulgent, because I don't believe in depriving yourself.'

Miranda rose to fame at the age of 13 after winning Dolly Magazine's modelling competition.

She then went on to become Australia's first Victoria's Secret Angel in 2007.

She now runs her own skincare company, Kora Organics.

She and Evan share two sons: Hart, four, and Myles, three. She also shares son Flynn, 12, with ex-husband Orlando Bloom.

She is extremely close to Orlando and his fiancée Katy Perry, with the singer previously saying their relationship dynamic was that of a 'modern family'.
