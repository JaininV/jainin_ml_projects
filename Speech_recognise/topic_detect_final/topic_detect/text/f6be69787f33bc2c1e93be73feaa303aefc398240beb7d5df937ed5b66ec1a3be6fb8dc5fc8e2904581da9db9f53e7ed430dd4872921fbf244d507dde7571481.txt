She is known for her liberal views and turbulent private life. So Mia Farrow, pictured, surprised her fans when she launched an apparent 'attack' on the Sussexes last week.

The Rosemary's Baby star, 78, wrote: 'Here's my unkind thought of the day: "I'm getting a little bit tired of Harry and Meghan."

The message predictably went down terribly with the Sussex Squad, an online group of the couple's fans, but also concerned scores of Farrow's Twitter followers.

One commenter suggested that the actress was being hypocritical, noting her 'family dirty laundry [that] we've been subjected to for decades'.

Another Twitter user shared stories from Farrow's 'toxic' relationship with director Woody Allen, writing: 'Imagine having this many skeletons in one's closet but having the nerve to say you are tired of a man and woman you do not know and have not been seen or heard from in months.'

Farrow quickly deleted the tweet, which one Sussex supporter branded 'cruel and unnecessary'.

The actress and Allen have for 20 years made headlines with conflicting abuse allegations.

Their adopted daughter Dylan has accused Allen of sexually abusing her when she was seven.

But another of Farrow's adopted daughters, Soon-Yi Previn, has claimed that Farrow was 'an abusive, controlling mother', a sentiment echoed by adopted son Moses Farrow.

Allen, who in 1997 married Ms Previn, has consistently denied the abuse allegations, arguing Dylan was brainwashed by her mother.
