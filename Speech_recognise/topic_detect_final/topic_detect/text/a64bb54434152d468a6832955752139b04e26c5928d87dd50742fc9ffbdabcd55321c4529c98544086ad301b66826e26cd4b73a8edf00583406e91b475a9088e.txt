In 2012, the Canadian government-sanctioned Federation of Quebec Maple Syrup Producers discovered that its precious barrels of sweet sap had been (gasp) stolen. Gone was the sugary liquid that filled the FPAQ warehouses. In its stead was mere water, unfit to pour over a hot stack of pancakes or glaze a juicy pork chop. It sounds silly, but the event cost FPAQ $18.7 million CAD and ranks among the most costly thefts in Canadian history. Judging by the fact that syrup production accounts for about $1.1 billion CAD to Canada's GDP, the country's government took the crime very seriously. Now, the story is getting the Hollywood adaptation treatment in a half-hour comedy series coming to Prime Video.

Canada produces 90% of the world's maple syrup, and about 72% of that supply comes from the province of Quebec. That means at least 70% of the entire world's syrup was stolen and illegally distributed sometime between 2011 and July 2012. This robbery came to be called the Great Canadian Maple Syrup Heist and it was a deep conspiracy against what many consider to be a bona fide cartel, making ringleader Richard Vallieres and his associates seem like Robin Hood-like figures and their eventual fining and imprisonment feel a bit tragic. FPAQ has such a vice-grip on the Canadian maple syrup industry that producers have turned to the black market in order to eke out a profit on their own. The morally fascinating nature of the heist has already earned it an episode on Netflix's docu-series "Dirty Money," but now a fictionalized account will tell the tale of the elaborate crime.
