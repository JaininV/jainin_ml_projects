DAVID de Gea has agreed to take a massive pay-cut as part of his new deal with Manchester United, reports suggest.

De Gea's contract runs out in June and United have yet to activate his year-long contract extension clause.

According to ESPN, however, the goalkeeper has agreed on a new four-year deal with the Red Devils that includes a major pay cut.

But there's also a catch in the Spain international's agreement as it involves highly-incentivised terms.

The 32-year-old is currently the Manchester giants' top earner on Â£375,000 per week.

De Gea will see a significant reduction to his salary but also a rise in performance-related bonuses, such as financial incentives for keeping clean sheets.

United have been looking at alternatives to replace the Spaniard between the sticks, such as Porto's Diogo Costa and Brentford's David Raya.

But manager Erik ten Hag appears set to hold on to his keeper and will now focus on nailing down some other key players for next season.

Ten Hag looks set to shift his attention to Diogo Dalot and Marcus Rashford this summer.

Dalot's contract runs out next year but the full-back has been offered a five-year deal that he is keen on.

Negotiations are still ongoing with Rashford, whose contract also expires in 2024 and the Red Devils want to secure their top star for the long term.

That is after Luke Shaw put pen to paper on a four-year extension at Old Trafford.

De Gea joined United in 2011 and has had 186 clean sheets in 534 appearances.

The ex-Atletico Madrid star also won the 2013 Premier League, the 2016 FA Cup, the 2017 Europa League as well as two League Cups.
