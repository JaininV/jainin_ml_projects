Mamelodi Sundowns will look to regain their form when they face Algerian side CR Belouizdad in the CAF Champions League quarter-final this Saturday. DStv Premiership champions Sundowns have only won one game in their past six matches dating back to 1 April 2023, when they defeated Coton Sport 2-1 in the group stages of the CAF Champions League.

Last Saturday, Sundowns saw their 25-match unbeaten streak in all competitions end at the hands of Stellenbosch FC. The Brazilians took the lead thanks to Aubrey Modiba’s curling effort from range but a quick-fire brace by Iqraam Rayners was enough to see the Cape side through to the semi-finals of the Nedbank Cup.
