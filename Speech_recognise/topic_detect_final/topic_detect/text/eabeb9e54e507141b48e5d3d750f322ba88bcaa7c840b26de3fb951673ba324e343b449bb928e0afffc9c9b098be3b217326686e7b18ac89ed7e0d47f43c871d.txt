Years ago I was a smoker, I topped out at over a pack a day and one of the things that helped me quit was this texting program that would remind you of the benefits as I recovered from that addiction. Every couple days it would tell me things like, you should be able to walk further now, you should be able to taste foods a bit better now, you should be able to.. and so on and so forth. That's what worked for me. I was a bit spoiled because many others before me had accomplished similar results without the help of a digital assistant of the like. Another factor, perhaps the harder one, was I stopped associating with those who insisted on self-injurious behaviors like smoking whether individually or as a group. This was hard but it helped a lot, because I no longer had that toxic habit reinforced socially for me. It was hard but it was important to me. That's why I was so willing to "offend" certain who had no qualms about hurting themselves, myself, or even others with their behavior. I wonder what other smoking-likeâ€”or-adjacent habitual and ritualized addictions we have that we can help each other encourage to let go of. I recently quit social media. One day later, I called an old friend I hadn't heard from in awhile. Three days later I said hello to a stranger on the bus. What should I expect next?
