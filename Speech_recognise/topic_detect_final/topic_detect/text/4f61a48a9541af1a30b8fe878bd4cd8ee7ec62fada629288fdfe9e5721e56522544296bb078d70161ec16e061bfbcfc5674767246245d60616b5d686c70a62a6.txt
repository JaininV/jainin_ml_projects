Welcome to today’s Photo of the Day! Here we have the first real overhaul of the Luger pistol as we know it. this is the 1906 Luger. Before the 1906 variation, there was the 1900. The 1900 and 1906 are incredibly similar which really shows how ingenious Georg Luger’s first attempt was at getting this whole pistol thing right. The 1906 Luger changed a few things.  The safeties began being marked “safe” and “fire” (in whatever language necessary from the order). Not all had marked safeties. The toggle or toggle grips for lack of a better term are now a solid knurled chunk rather than the older dished-out version. The mainspring was changed from flat to coiled and the bolt contour was modified for stronger extraction (and the extractor was changed).

“Fixed sights, with the DWM monogram on the front toggle link, “crown/N” proofs on the barrel, chamber, breech block and toggle link, and (excluding the unnumbered magazine) matching commercial pattern external serial numbers. Fitted with a set of straw small parts and a nickel finished magazine with a hardwood base. Includes an unmarked leather holster with spaces for the following included accessories; brass tipped steel cleaning rod, small blued steel pin punch, loading/takedown tool and an extra nickel finished unnumbered magazine. The body of the holster, under the flap, has been trimmed to expose more of the pistol.”
