To construct a rich search experience over private, heterogeneous material in online, mobile, and corporate apps, Azure Cognitive Search (formerly known as "Azure Search") provides developers with infrastructure, APIs, and tools.

Any software that surfaces text to users relies on search, and common applications include document or catalogue search, online shopping apps, and data exploration over proprietary material. You will use the following tools when building a search service.

A full-text search engine that operates over a search index of user-generated content.

Extensive indexing with lexical analysis and optional AI enrichment is available for content extraction and transformation.

Rich query syntax for text, fuzzy, autocomplete, geo-search, and other search types.

Programmability through REST APIs and client libraries in Azure SDKs

Azure integration at the data layer, machine learning layer, and AI (Cognitive Services)

Access Vision, Language, Search, and Speech Cognitive Services with a single API key. Quickly connect services together to achieve more insights into your content and easily integrate with other services like Azure Search.
