The 16th edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2023 has given a lot to the fans to cheer about, with one of the biggest factors being the return of legendary skipper MS Dhoni, as the 41-year-old donned the jersey of the four-time champions Chennai Super Kings once again.

Ever since Dhoni’s retirement from international cricket back in August 2020, many have been speculating about the wicketkeeper-batter’s retirement from the IPL as well. With Dhoni playing vintage knocks at the ongoing edition of the tournament, it could be quite the possibility that he could continue playing in the IPL beyond 2023.

Reflecting upon the same, former India cricketer Sarandeep Singh came forward to give his take on Dhoni’s potential retirement from the cash-rich league. Speaking to Jio Cinema, Sarandeep Singh said, "If he is fit, he can play. But when we speak about MS Dhoni, it’s always his call. Because no one can tell better than him how he would be feeling or how will his body respond."

"We have been seeing him for the last 15 years and this season as well. We saw him in the last game, against RCB, in the way he took those two catches. He ran from behind the wicket, called for the catch, and grabbed it. He simply takes the pressure on himself," he added.

Continuing upon the same, Sarandeep Singh heaped further praise on MS Dhoni. He opined that the 41-year-old’s retirement would totally depend on him and how he feels with time.

"He’s one of the best we have ever had. So, it totally depends on him; if he feels he can contribute It’s not just about playing but also about the contribution. You see the last game and the ones before. Whenever his team needs him, he comes and hits a few sixes or puts the score on the board. So, that’s a completely individual call for Dhoni," Sarandeep Singh concluded.
