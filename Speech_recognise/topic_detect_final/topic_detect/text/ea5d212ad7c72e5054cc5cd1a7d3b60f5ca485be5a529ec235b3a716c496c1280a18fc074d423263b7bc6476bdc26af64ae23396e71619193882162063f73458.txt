WE CAME across stylist Colin King’s Tribeca loft through the Instagram page of photographer and director William Jess Laird, who shot the home for a recent feature in the Wall Street Journal. After last week’s neutral, stylishly laid-back vibe as featured in this home in the Netherlands, I know my tastes must be changing, because this space has a similar feel. Both have masculine elements, but don’t actually feel overtly masculine. Both have museum-like vignettes with everything carefully considered and placed, yet both feel relaxed and comfortable at the same time. I don’t normally gravitate to spaces that are dark, rather favouring floor-to-ceiling windows and floods of light, but something about King’s home is cosy and inviting. Almost like a (chic) cocoon.

Before he became a stylist, Colin King studied dance in New York City. He transitioned his creative background to interiors by working with design firms on content creation and art direction. He is now a regular contributing stylist to publications such as Architectural Digest, T Magazine, and ELLE DECOR, and just published his first book.
