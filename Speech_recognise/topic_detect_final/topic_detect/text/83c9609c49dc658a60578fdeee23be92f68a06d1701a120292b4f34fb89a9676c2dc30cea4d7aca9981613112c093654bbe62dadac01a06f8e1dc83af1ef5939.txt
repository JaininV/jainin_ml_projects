WhatsApp lets you share your Status to your Facebook profile with just one tap. The ability to cross-post your Status on WhatsApp to Facebook saves you time and gives you the chance to make your content popular on two platforms at the same time. This is similar to the Share to Facebook functionality on Instagram that lets you share not just your posts but also Stories and Reels on Facebook at the same time.

Facebook Stories, on the other hand, are potentially visible to more people who may not be in your contacts. Moreover, Facebook is accessible worldwide, so your content gets more coverage.
