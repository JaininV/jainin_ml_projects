(MENAFN- UkrinForm) Russia has found ways to purchase banned weapons technology from the West.

That's according to the new york times , an Ukrinform correspondent reports.

"Senior tax and trade officials noted a surge in chips and other electronic components being sold to Russia through Armenia, Kazakhstan and other countries," the article reads.

They shared information on the flow of eight particularly sensitive categories of chips and other electronic devices that they have deemed as critical to the development of weapons, including Russian cruise missiles that have struck Ukraine.

"As the United States and the European Union rally to furnish Ukrainians with weapons to keep fighting against Russia, their own technology is being used by Russia to fight back," NYT wrote.

Late last month, American and European Union officials traded information on millions of dollars' worth of banned technology that was slipping through the cracks of their defenses and into Russian territory.

"One document marked with the seal of the U. S. Bureau of Industry and Security said that in 2022, Armenia imported 515 percent more chips and processors from the United States and 212 percent more from the European Union than in 2021. Armenia then exported 97 percent of those same products to Russia, the document said," the news outlet said.

Because of the huge global market for chips and other electronics, it is very difficult for Western countries to monitor compliance with sanctions.

"So far, the Russian military appears to have been relying on a large stockpile of electronics and weaponry it accumulated before the invasion. But that supply may be drying up, making it more urgent for Russia to obtain new shipments," NYT said.
