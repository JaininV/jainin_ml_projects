Rodrygo scored twice as Real Madrid cruised into the Champions League semi-finals on Tuesday, April 18, completing an emphatic 4-0 aggregate win against Chelsea that ends a disastrous season for the London club.

Looking to overturn a two-goal deficit at Stamford Bridge, Chelsea was however put out of their misery by Rodrygo who scored two second-half goals to confirm Real’s superiority. Chelsea had 19 goal attempts during the match but once again they lacked any cutting edge as they lost a fourth match in succession in all competitions since the club’s legend, Frank Lampard returned as interim manager in place of sacked Graham Potter.    Realistically, with next to no chance of finishing in the top four this campaign, the Blues will not be in Europe’s premier club competition next season and have little to play for other than pride in the final weeks of 2022-23. That is a sensationally poor return on the £600 million that the Blues have spent under Todd Boehly’s stewardship in the past 12 months, and massive changes need to be made to fix a team who were celebrating winning the European Cup less than two years ago.
