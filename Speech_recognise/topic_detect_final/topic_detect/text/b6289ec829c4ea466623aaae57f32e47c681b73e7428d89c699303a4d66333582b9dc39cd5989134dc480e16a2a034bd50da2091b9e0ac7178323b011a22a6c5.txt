Facebook can often be a minefield full of terrible memes among the good ones. Sure, there are lots of great meme pages that we love on the platform, but there's also a lot of content that's overused and just completely unfunny. It really depends where you're looking, since others in your age range tend to get your humor a lot better, but the older part of Facebook tends to joke primarily about their hatred of users of social media, which is ironic because they're posting these very same memes on social media.

The worst are posted by your reclusive middle-aged neighbor with the 18 security cameras and a profound hatred of younger generations. There's a consistent lack of quality in all of his memes, and as they're reposted by others like him, they become even worse, now deep-fried beyond recognition. Here are some of our favorite bad memes that were definitely made by Boomers.
