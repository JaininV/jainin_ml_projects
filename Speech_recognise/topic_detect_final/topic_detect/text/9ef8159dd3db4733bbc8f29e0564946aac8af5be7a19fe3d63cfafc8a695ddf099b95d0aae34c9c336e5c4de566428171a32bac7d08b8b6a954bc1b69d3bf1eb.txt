* Quality assets in a highly prospective region: Ongoing work has demonstrated the potential to continue to deliver positive results, with the projects located within the highly productive cordillera of western South America, the worldâ€™s largest copper-producing region.

* A solid base to build upon: The MRE and exploration target at Bramaderos forms a solid base for the company to build upon, with the MRE limited to just two of the many prospects at the project.

* Personnel with the right experience: The key personnel in Sunstone have extensive successful and applicable experience, including being involved in the Tujuh Bukit (Indonesia) and Cascabel (Ecuador) porphyry discoveries â€“ this experience is now being applied successfully to Sunstoneâ€™s projects.

* Well served by infrastructure: All projects are in areas of good transport and utility infrastructure and are located at relatively low RLs (up to 1,500 metres) and manageable topography in the Cordillera Occidental (NYSE:) of Ecuador â€“ the tenements cover a mixture of farming and wooded land, with the company having good relationships with locals.
