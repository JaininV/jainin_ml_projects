Nowadays, Indian weddings are incomplete without epic bride entries and social media feeds are full of pictures of brides and grooms making spectacular entries. Here’s another such super cute bridal entry that has gone viral on social media.

The bride dressed in a beautiful rani pink lehenga made a playful bridal entry on the song “Saiyaan Dil Main Aana Re - Vylom Remix”.

Donning a heavily embellished lehenga, the bride can be seen walking down the aisle with a bunch of heart-shaped red balloons covering her face towards her groom.

After reaching her groom, she could be seen leaving the balloon in the air and showing her beautiful face to the groom who was patiently waiting for her.

Towards the end of the video, the groom can be seen praising her beauty and coming forward to hug his bride. The friends and family members of the couple can be seen cheering for them.

What makes the video more special is that the couple is a dwarf couple, despite their limitation, they seem to be fully enjoying their D-day.

The video was shared by YouTube by @mini_influencers31with the caption, “Moment he saw me!” Since being shared, it has been viewed more than 9.2 million times and has several likes and comments.

One person in the comments wrote, " The way he hugged her was so cute." A second person added, " Made for each other." " This is the cutest wedding video I've ever seen," said another person.
