Smith & Wesson Semi-Auto Pistols Other Smith & Wesson Semi-Automatic Pistols from the 1950's to Present

I would like to add a spurred hammer to my 4013TSW.  Current bobbed hammer is a mim part.  Could someone please supply part no. for a spurred hammer or what models would interchange.  I reviewed 8 pages of a search for spurred hammer and could not find a reference to a 4013 TSW.  Thanks in advance.
