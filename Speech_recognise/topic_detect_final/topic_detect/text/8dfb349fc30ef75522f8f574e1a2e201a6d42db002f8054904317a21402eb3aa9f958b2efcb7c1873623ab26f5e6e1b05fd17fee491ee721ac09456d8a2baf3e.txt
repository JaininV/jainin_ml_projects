Virag told the business website vg.hu in an interview published on Wednesday that the bank could decide on “a significant narrowing” of the upper end of the corridor at next Tuesday’s meeting of the Monetary Council.

The National Bank of Hungary (NBH) raised its overnight collateralised loan rate, the top of the corridor, to 25% from 15.5% last October and launched a new one-day deposit with an 18% interest rate to stabilize the forint currency, which had plunged to all-time lows past 430 to the euro.

The forint has since firmed substantially, trading at one-year highs this week at around 371.

“Extreme risk scenarios have been priced out, so we no longer need to maintain such a huge room of maneuver,” Virag said.

He said the question of the 18% rate on the one-day deposit could be on the agenda only at subsequent monthly policy meetings.
