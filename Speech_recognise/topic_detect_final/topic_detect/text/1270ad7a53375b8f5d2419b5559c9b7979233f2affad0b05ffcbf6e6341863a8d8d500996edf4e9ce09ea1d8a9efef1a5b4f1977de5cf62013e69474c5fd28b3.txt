Retired NRL player Brett Stewart will face court next month after being charged with cocaine possession.

The former Manly Sea Eagles fullback was stopped and searched by police on March 10 on Sydney's Northern Beaches when they allegedly found 0.61 grams of cocaine.

The 38-year-old was charged with one count of possessing a prohibited drug.

Stewart did not appear at Manly Local Court on Wednesday when his lawyer requested a two-week adjournment to seek instructions from her client.

The matter will return to court on May 3.

The two-time premiership winner represented Australia and NSW in State of Origin and played 233 games for Manly between 2003 and 2016 before retiring in 2017.

In 2019 he lashed out at the NRL's no-fault stand-down policy to ban players from taking the field if they were facing serious charges in court - even before they are found guilty.

Stewart was cleared of sexually assaulting a 17-year-old girl in the street in 2009 in a case that left him and his fellow ex-Manly star brother, Glenn, furious with the governing body over his treatment.

He said the NRL had learned nothing from his case and that players should be considered innocent until proven guilty.

'How the NRL thinks they can do that... it baffles me,' Stewart said.

'You'd think they would have learned a few things from my case. From the outside looking in, it doesn't seem like they have.'
