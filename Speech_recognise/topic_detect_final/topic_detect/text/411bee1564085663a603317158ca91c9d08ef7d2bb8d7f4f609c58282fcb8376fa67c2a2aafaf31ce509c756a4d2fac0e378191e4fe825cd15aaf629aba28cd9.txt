Adidas is one of the most iconic and influential brands in the footwear industry. The German sportswear giant has been producing some of the most popular and innovative sneakers for decades, collaborating with various artists, celebrities, and designers along the way. Some of their most notable partnerships include Kanye West, Pharrell Williams, Raf Simons, and Stella McCartney.

Adidas is not only interested in working with established names. They also support and nurture emerging talents, giving them a platform to showcase their creativity and vision. One of these talents is Gerrit Jacob, a young designer from Hamburg who has been making a name for himself with his bold and colorful collections.

Jacob recently teamed up with the shoe label to create a flaming hot collection of sneakers featuring three of their classic models: the Superstar, the Gazelle, and the Forum 84.

The latest collaboration is part of Jacob's Fall/Winter 2023 "SCUM" collection, which explores queer stereotypes and subcultures through vibrant and playful designs. The sneakers are all hand-painted by Jacob himself, using flame stencils to create burning outlines on the white leather uppers. The result is a striking contrast between the fiery colors and the classic silhouettes, reflecting Jacob's unique esthetic and identity.

The Superstar is painted in a bright pink hue, with the signature shell toe and three stripes intact. The Gazelle is drenched in a purple shade, with serrated stripes and gold foil branding adding some shine. The Forum 84 is covered in a teal tone, with the ankle strap and trefoil logo providing some contrast. All three pairs feature white rubber soles and laces, as well as Gerrit Jacob's signature tiger logo on the tongue.

If you are looking for flaming-hot sneakers to spice up your wardrobe, you should definitely keep an eye out for this collaboration. It is one of the most exciting and original sneaker releases of the year, and it will surely make you stand out from the crowd.
