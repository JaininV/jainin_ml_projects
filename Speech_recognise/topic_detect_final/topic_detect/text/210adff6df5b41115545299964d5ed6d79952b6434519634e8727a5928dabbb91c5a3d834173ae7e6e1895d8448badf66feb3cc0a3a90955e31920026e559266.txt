“Here we do not accept celiac.”  That’s what Valentina Liborati, an artisan and food blogger from Sarzana, heard from a Tuscan restaurateur who had called to book a table in recent days.  “For the first time in my life,” she wrote on her popular Instagram page, “I heard a sentence that left me literally speechless. I, who usually answer in kind and be flooded with words, kept silent. I felt discriminated against and excluded, and being different is wrong. I’ve been suffering from celiac since 1989 and never I hear something like that.”  For years, “Valentina Gluten Free” has become a reference point for those who have to deal with the impossibility of consuming gluten on a daily basis and who, also thanks to her, have learned that one can still eat well.  “I haven’t felt this way for a long time,” she continued, “and yet I am accustomed to being deceived and ignorant. I have been excluded from the club by reason of my illness. Because of what I did not choose but which is part of me in an unbreakable way. Discrimination was made because of an intrinsic quality of mine.”

“It all makes no sense – note – because preparing a substitute for celiac disease is simple, you just need to know the disease to prepare a meal safely with a few simple precautions. Otherwise, following this logic, people with other dietary needs or sensitivities should stay “Outside the building. Towards celiac there’s a total lockdown. I hope – and seal – to get those who have thought of telling me these things to reflect on that and to make people understand how far behind we are in 2023.”
