Interim Port Vale manager Andy Crosby has added coach John Schofield to his backroom team.

Schofield was in attendance during Tuesday’s match against Ipswich Town.

The pair worked together for the Northern Ireland U21 side with Schofield replacing Crosby when the former left to join Darrell Clarke at Vale Park.

Crosby told the media: “It has been a challenging period of time at the football club. I looked at it and needed some support for myself and the rest of the coaching team and the players.

“I have worked with John Schofield before. He is an infectious coach, he is an infectious personality, he will bring something different to us, to our group and he can impact both on and off the grass.

“I am delighted he has come to work with me. I trust him 100 per cent and, when the players get to know him more, they will really appreciate his qualities.”
