Former U. S. President Donald Trump’s NFTs floor price declined 58% to 0.183 ETH — roughly $382 — in the last 24 hours after he announced a second collection on April 18.

According to CryptoSlam data, the first collection was involved in 1,210 sales transactions, and its trading volume surged 889% to $379,819 in the last 24 hours.

Meanwhile, OpenSea data showed that the digital assets saw 1,503 sales — with its sales volume rising 188% to 296 ETH during the reporting period.

President Trump’s new collection — “Series 2” — includes 47,000 NFTs minted on the Polygon blockchain and priced at $99 each. The collection is sold out, according to its official website.

President Trump said he chose to keep the “price of the Trading Cards the same as last time” even though he could have raised it “much higher.” According to Trump, he decided against this because he would be given “no nice guy credit.”

According to available data, the former President made up to $1 million from the sales of the first collection.

The Series 2 collection depicts the former President as George Washington, a golden king chess piece holding a globe and a U. S. flag, the king of hearts in a game of cards, and a rockstar.

Like the first iteration, the second collection incentivizes buyers with the promise of a gala dinner with the President at his Mar-a-Lago residence. However, this offer is only available to holders who buy 47 pieces of the digital trading cards.

Meanwhile, the new collection is also not owned, managed, or controlled by Trump, his company, or their affiliates. The website also adds that the NFTs “are not political and have nothing to do with any political campaign.”
