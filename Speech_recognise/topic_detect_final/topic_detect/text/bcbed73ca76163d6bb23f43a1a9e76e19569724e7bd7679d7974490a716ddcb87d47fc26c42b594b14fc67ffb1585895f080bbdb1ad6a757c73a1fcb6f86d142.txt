Those who were able to take Diablo 4 out for a test run during last month’s weekend beta tests will find a slightly different game waiting for them when it launches this June.

In response to player feedback received during the beta test, Blizzard will be making major adjustments to the multiplayer ARPG’s dungeons, some of which will be sporting new layouts to prevent the need for backtracking. The team will also be increasing the chance for dungeon events to spawn, tweaking dungeon objectives to make them less tedious, and will be doing away with the dungeon reset button and will be replacing it with a new system for replaying dungeons.

Each of the five playable classes will also be getting a balance pass prior to the game’s launch in addition to sweeping adjustments to the stun and freeze durations on elite monsters and updates to legendary powers.

Players can also look forward to a more challenging fight against Butcher on Nightmare (Tier 3) and Torment (Tier 4) difficulties and guaranteed reward chests from cellars. Details can be found on the Diablo 4 official site.
