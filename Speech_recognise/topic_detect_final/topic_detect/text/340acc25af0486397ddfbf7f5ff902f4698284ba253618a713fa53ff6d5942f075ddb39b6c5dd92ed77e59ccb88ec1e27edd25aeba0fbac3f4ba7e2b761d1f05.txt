Sadio Mane Suspended from Bayern Munich Next Match! The Senegalese international will not participate in their next encounter.

Bayern Munich forward Sadio Mane has been suspended for their next match. This is because of his conduct in their last game.

Bayern Munich lost 3-0 away to Manchester City in their UEFA Champions League first leg encounter on Tuesday night. Reports strongly suggest that Mane struck teammate Leroy Sane in the face after the match.

The Bavarians did not comment on the incident but confirmed that Mane behaved in an unsavoury manner.

“Sadio Mané, 31, will not be included in the FC Bayern squad for this Saturday’s home match against 1899 Hoffenheim.” The club stated.

“This is due to his misconduct after Bayern’s Champions League match at Manchester City. Mané will also be given a fine.”

Bayern are now extremely unlikely to manage to make it to the next round of the UEFA Champions League. It has been a very tough start at the helm for head coach Thomas Tuchel.

“We played well for the first 20 minutes of the second half but weren’t rewarded. We went behind to a long-range goal.

“The reaction was very good, even more so in the second half. We tried to swing the momentum back in our favour.

“Obviously, everyone is disappointed. It didn’t feel like a 3-0 loss, but that’s what it is.

“It’s a big ask to turn it around, but we won’t give up. A home game in Germany is a home game in Germany.

“It’s not over until it’s over.”
