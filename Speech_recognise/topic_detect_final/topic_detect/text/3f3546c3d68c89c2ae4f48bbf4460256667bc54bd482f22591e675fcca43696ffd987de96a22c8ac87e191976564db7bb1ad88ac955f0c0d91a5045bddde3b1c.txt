Tasmanian police are investigating the deliberate ramming of an entrance to a police station on Hobart's eastern shores, saying they do not yet know why someone "would want to do that".

Officers said a car was driven into the front entrance of the Clarence Plains Police Station, smashing the front doors, around 5:30am this morning.

There were no police officers on site at the time.

Police said the the offenders did not go into the main offices and nothing was stolen.

"An individual or individuals have deliberately driven a vehicle into the front entrance of the Clarence Plains Police Station, causing considerable damage," a police spokesman said.

"At this stage, who is responsible is undetermined.

The station itself is set back from the main road and on the same grounds as the Tasmania Police Academy facility at Rokeby.

Forensic officers are examining the scene and collecting evidence in a bid to locate the vehicle involved.

Police have also appealed to the public for information.
