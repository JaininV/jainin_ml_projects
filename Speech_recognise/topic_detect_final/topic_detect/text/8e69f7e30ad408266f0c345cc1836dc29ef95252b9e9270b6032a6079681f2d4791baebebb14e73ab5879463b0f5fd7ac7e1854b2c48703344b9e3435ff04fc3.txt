The Red Skywalker Wavespell starts today with thirteen days to awaken our adventurous spirit and try new things!

In the Light: exploring inner and outer landscapes; takings risks; seeking new adventures; finding other ways to do what we do

In the Shadow: “Life’s backpack” feels too heavy as we carry burdens that may not be even ours; we prefer to stay with the familiar

Questions for Reflection: What are you carrying in your “backpack” on a physical (clutter), mental (chatter), emotional (turmoil) and spiritual (disconnection) levels?

Actions for Transformation: Take time to explore within and see what feels as dense to you. You may discover that you are taking things as yours, which in reality belong to others (as traumas, old wounds, difficult experiences, opinions, etc.). “Others” may be current or old relationships, and also your ancestors and lineage.

Each red glyph with one stand-alone dot (Magnetic Tone) initiates a period of 52 days called Castle. Red Magnetic Skywalker is the first day of the White Castle of Refinement. It is a time to sort out what you want to keep in your life and what you are ready to let go of.
