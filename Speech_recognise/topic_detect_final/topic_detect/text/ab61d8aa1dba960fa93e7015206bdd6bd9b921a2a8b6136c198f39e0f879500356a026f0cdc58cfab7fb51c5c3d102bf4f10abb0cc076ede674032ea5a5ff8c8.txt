City of Casey is throwing a campfire family event designed to build the bonds between fathers and their children.

The event will be held at the Casey Youth Hub in Narre Warren on Tuesday 2 May, 6:30pm – 8:30pm.

The outdoor event promises to be a night of entertainment, games, drumming, marshmallow toasting, and even a free sausage sizzle with vegetarian and halal options available.

“It’s the perfect opportunity to bond with your children and others in the community while enjoying some delicious food and fun activities,” the council wrote.

Casey’s Dads Matter programs designed to help dads and father figures develop social networks, connect with their children through fun activities, and recognise the vital role they play in their family structure.

Events like this one highlight the importance of fathers in a child’s life.

The Dads Matter programs are open to dads, stepdads, grandfathers, or any other man who plays a significant role in a child’s life.

The support network follows a flexible format that allows dads to come and go according to their schedule, so they don’t have to worry about missing out on any of the fun.

The campfire family event will be held outdoors.

The council is encouraging attendees to dress appropriately.

“Come prepared for a night of fun under the stars,” they wrote.

“Make some memories, meet other father figures, and show your children the importance of spending time together as a family.”
