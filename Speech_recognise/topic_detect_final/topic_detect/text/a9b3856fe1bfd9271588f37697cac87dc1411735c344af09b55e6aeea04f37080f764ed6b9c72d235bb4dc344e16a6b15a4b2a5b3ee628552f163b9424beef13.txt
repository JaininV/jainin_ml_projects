New York City subway riders in the mid 20th century knew who Miss Subways was. The beauty pageant, spotlighting “every day” New York women, featured placards which hung on all the trains (like the one above for 1948 winner Thelma Porter).

Well, Miss Subways is back, hosted by the City Reliquary Museum in a fabulous, flamboyant event in Coney Island. And this year, one of the judges will be none other — than Greg Young of the Bowery Boys Podcast!

Here are the details:

Updated for the 21st century and first presented in 2017, the new Miss Subways by the City Reliquary expands on the progressive history of Miss Subways as the first racially integrated beauty competition and is open to contestants of all gender identities, body types, and ages 18+ to compete for the prized title of Miss Subways.

Are YOU Miss Subways 2023?

Contestants are invited to present an original performance that captures their relationship with the NYC subway, in all its complexity. “Performance” may be interpreted broadly. We welcome song, dance, poetry, or any other talent—Rubik’s cube solving, hula hooping, speed knitting, playing the sousaphone…surprise us!

Past performances have included an ode to the G train, an experimental soundscape inspired by the Q, songs about subway proselytizers, and an appearance by the Wicked Witch of the Upper East Side and an immigrant from Oz.
