Lewis McGugan felt sorry for two Nottingham Forest players during their 2-0 defeat to Manchester United. The Reds were beaten after goals from Antony and Diogo Dalot decided the contest.

Steve Cooper has some soul-searching to do. His team haven’t won for 10 games now and they’re staring at relegation back to the Championship after a single season in the top flight.

Forest went with a two-man midfield against United. Remo Freuler and Danilo started in the engine room and it proved a mistake, with the Red Devils running riot in that area of the pitch.

McGugan has claimed that he felt sorry for the two midfielders. He also suggested that the team can’t keep utilising Morgan Gibbs-White as a luxury player against teams like United.

The man who played for several years for the first team is still a regular at the City Ground. He has been to watch the team on their travels this season too and is a Forest supporter.

McGugan knows what it takes to play in midfield for the Reds. He scored plenty of goals and registered an abundance of assists during his time playing for Forest.

Clearly, he believes Cooper isn’t getting the best out of the midfielders at his disposal. He’s chopped and changed frequently this season with limited success and now things are at breaking point.

It’s hard to disagree with the man who came through the academy ranks at the City Ground. The Reds are really struggling at the moment and it’s hard to see where another point comes from.

Freuler is an international performer who captained Atalanta last season and performed in the Champions League. He’s been utilised really poorly by Cooper at Forest and he can’t get going.

Danilo is a worker. He has a brilliant energy to his game and the Forest head coach would be very wise to persist with him for the remainder of the campaign now.

Forest are staring at relegation right now and in the coming weeks, it could become a reality. Something has to give and Cooper is walking a tightrope at the moment.
