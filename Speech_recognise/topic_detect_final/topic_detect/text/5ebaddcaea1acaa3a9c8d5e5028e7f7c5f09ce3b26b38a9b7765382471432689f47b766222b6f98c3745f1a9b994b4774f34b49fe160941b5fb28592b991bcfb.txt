At age 36, Augustine Choge of Kenya has been a world-class runner for almost two decades. Among his accomplishments are the 2005 world cross country junior title, the 2006 Commonwealth Games 5,000-meter title, and silver (2012) and bronze (2016) indoor 3,000-meter world indoor medals. He has incredible range, from a 1:44.86 800-meter best to a 59:26 half marathon PR.

Since 2018, Choge has been part of the NN Running team, whose most famous member is Eliud Kipchoge. Both men will run the Boston Marathon on Monday. (In the photo above, Kipchoge is looking at his watch, with Choge most immediately to his left.) Runner’s World sat down with Choge three days before the race to learn what it’s like, physically and psychologically, to run every day with the greatest marathoner in history. There’s much wisdom here for runners of all levels.
