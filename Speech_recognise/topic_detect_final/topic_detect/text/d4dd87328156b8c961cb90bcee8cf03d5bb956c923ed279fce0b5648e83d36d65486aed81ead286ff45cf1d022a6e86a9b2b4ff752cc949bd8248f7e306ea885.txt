The fire hazard rating for LSAC is high.

This week’s forecast has changed, now calling for a lack of sufficient moisture coupled with anticipated wind and low RH (relative humidity) values.

In the event that conditions remain poor or worsen, a total and complete fire ban may be issued in the near future.

During this fire advisory, new fire permits will not be issued. While existing fires under permit will be allowed, they must be continuously monitored.

Extensions will not be granted on existing permits. Burn barrels, cooking or warming fires (campfires) will be allowed in acceptable fire pits in accordance with regulation.

“Please exercise use caution with any burning activities,” LSAC stated.

“Please report any wildfire to 911 with exact location to assist Lac Ste. Anne County fire personnel in locating and extinguishing these fires in a timely fashion. Your co-operation is greatly appreciated.”
