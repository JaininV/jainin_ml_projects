Is buying a gun indicative of paranoia or does owning a gun cause paranoia?

This week there were two separate shootings where a person went to the wrong address and ended up being shot. One of them died, and the other, while shot in the head and arm — survived.

Sixteen-year-old Ralph Yarl went to pick up his twin brothers in Kansas City, Missouri, but he got the address wrong. When he rang the doorbell of the house a block away from the correct address, the 84-year-old resident shot him in the head through the glass door without a word exchanged between them. Ralph fell to the ground, and the man shot him again. Ralph Yarl is Black, and the shooter is white.

Ralph survived and was released from the hospital today and is being cared for by a family member who is a nurse.

Yesterday, a 20-year-old white woman was gunned down when the car she was riding in pulled into the wrong driveway in a rural area of Hebron, NY, just outside of Albany. Three other people were in the car, and they went to the wrong address.

Kaylin Gillis was killed by the homeowner as they were backing out of his driveway. Again, no words were exchanged between the shooter and the persons in the vehicle. The shooter has been booked with second-degree murder, but he has been uncooperative with authorities.

I’ll ask it again — Is buying a gun indicative of paranoia or does owning a gun cause paranoid delusions? These shootings were the acts of disturbed white men who have serious anger and impulse issues, yet they were allowed to own firearms.

Does owning a gun cause this type of paranoia? Is the false-bravado and extreme defense impulse created by the act of having a gun in one’s possession? Neither of these events would have happened if the homeowners did not have guns. There may have been some shouting, but Ralph would have been free to back away and seek out the correct address, and Kaylin would still be alive.
