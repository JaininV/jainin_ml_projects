Congress leader Rajkumar Raju from Prayagraj has sparked a controversy as he laid Indian national flag on Atiq Ahmed and his brother Ashraf's grave. He recited 'kalma' at the grave and says he'll fight to get honour to Atiq and Ashraf. Blaming Yogi Adityanath-led BJP govt for Atiq's murder, Congress leader called Atiq a 'Shaheed' and demanded 'Bharat Ratna' for him. Congress party later expelled Rajkumar Raju from the party for 6 years.
