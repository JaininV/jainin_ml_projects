HelenP. I Euro trades in triangle and can rose to trendline

Hi folks today I'm prepared for you EURO analytics. For some time the price decreased, reached the level 1.0835 tested it and started a local uptrend. Euro continued to move, rose to a resistance zone 1.0915-1.0930, made a slight correction and broke through it. The price reached resistance at the level 1.1075, where the local uptrend was completed and Euro began to fall. Over time, the price created a descending triangle, inside which it is now traded. Recently, the price tried to break through the support zone, but could not gain a fixed below and returned inside the triangle and increased. Now the Euro has fallen back again to the support zone, re-tested it and is trading higher. It seems to me that the price may continue to rise and reach the trend line. Therefore, the target for the Euro will be set at level 1.0965, which corresponds to the trend line. If you like my analytics you may support me with your like/comment ❤️
