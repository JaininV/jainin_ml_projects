Simeone Inzaghi's men returned to Italy from the Estadio da Luz with a two-goal lead in their bag, which means the Portuguese side have all to do in the return leg.

Nicolo Barella's header opened the scoring for Inter while Romelu Lukaku converted from the spot to double the lead.

However, they head into this fixture on the back of a 1-0 defeat to Monza in Serie A courtesy of Luca Caldirola's late goal. Inzaghi would expect a positive response from his troops as they have the tie firmly in their hands following an impressive performance away from home.

Meanwhile, Benfica suffered a shock 1-0 defeat to Chaves and their lead at the top was cut down to just four points. They are on a three-game losing streak and the quarter-final curse could once again come back to haunt them as they have never made it to the Champions League last four in its current format.
