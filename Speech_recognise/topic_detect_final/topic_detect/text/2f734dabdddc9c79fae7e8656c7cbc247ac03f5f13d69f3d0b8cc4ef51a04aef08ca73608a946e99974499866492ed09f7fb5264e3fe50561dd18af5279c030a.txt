In Vanity Mirror’s world, the sun is always shining, the colours are forever vivid, and the grooves are ever-present  With their latest single, ‘Dandelion Wish,’ the duo take us through their hazy dreamscape and show us how to see life in technicolour.

Producer/songwriter Brent Randall and drummer Johnny Toomey make up the bedroom-pop act listeners known as Vanity Mirror. Randall and Toomey have a lasting creative partnership, having already worked together in Los Angeles baroque-pop group Electric Looking Glass. Randall, based in Toronto, and Toomey, hailing from Los Angeles, creatively bring out the best in each other. The duo evoke notes of Lennon and McCartney fusing their individual styles to create a unique sound that feels both new and comfortingly nostalgic.

That sound is on full display on ‘Dandelion Wish.’ Listeners can’t help but be swept away by the sunny piano riffs that carry the song, which Randall describes as “a sophisticated bedroom pop ditty for wayward situationships.” The duo worked with Los Angeles videographer Mat Dunlap on the accompanying music video, which feels like it was sent to us straight from the 80s.  It was shot on a Sony Handycam to get that authentic vintage look, and the pair planned out multiple monochromatic outfits that change as the song plays. The result? Pure magic.

‘Dandelion Wish’ is the second single from Vanity Mirror’s highly-anticipated debut album PUFF. The LP was written, recorded, performed, produced, and mixed by Randall, who pieced the project together in makeshift spaces while travelling across North America. Randall taped old pianos in public libraries and tracked vocals in abandoned houses, then sent the tracks to Toomey, who recorded drums in his L. A. basement using a handheld field recorder.

Be on the lookout for PUFF, out May 12th, 2023, via We Are Busy Bodies. It’s sure to be the perfect soundtrack to your summer.
