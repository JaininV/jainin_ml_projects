• Bereaved families requested coalition and opposition members to attend cemeteries as a sign of solidarity, expecting extra responsibility.

The traditional torch-lighting ceremony on Mount Herzl is a significant event in Israel’s national calendar. It occurs every year on the eve of Independence Day and marks the beginning of the country’s official celebrations. The ceremony honors the memory of fallen soldiers and victims of terror, recognizing their sacrifice and service to the nation.

However, recent years have seen increased tensions and disruptions during the event, prompting concerns over safety and security. To prevent provocateurs and unwanted guests from entering the ceremony, police have implemented strict measures to screen and check the accessories of the 4,000 invited attendees.

Despite the potential risks, special guests are expected to attend the ceremony as a show of support and solidarity. Prime Minister Netanyahu will be present, although he will not speak during the event. Instead, a congratulatory video of him will be shown at the beginning of the ceremony.

In addition to political figures, bereaved families have requested that coalition members and opposition members attend cemeteries together as a sign of unity and responsibility. This gesture reflects the somber and sensitive nature of the event, emphasizing the need for the respectful and peaceful observance.

As Israel celebrates its independence and honors its fallen heroes, the traditional torch-lighting ceremony on Mount Herzl is a powerful reminder of its history and identity. It is a time for reflection, remembrance, and recognition of the sacrifices made for a shared vision of freedom and peace.
