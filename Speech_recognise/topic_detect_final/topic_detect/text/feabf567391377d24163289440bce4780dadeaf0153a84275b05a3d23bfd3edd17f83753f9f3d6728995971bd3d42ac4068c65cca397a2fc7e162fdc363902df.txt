The Athletic’s Charlie Eccleshare has suggested that Tottenham Hotspur may have to decide between hiring a big-name manager who could persuade Harry Kane to stay and hiring more of a project manager.

The topic of Kane’s future looks likely to dominate the summer transfer window, just as it did two years ago, with the striker set to enter the final 12 months of his contract at Spurs.

90 min reported last week that Tottenham had put off contract talks with the striker until they have confirmed a new head coach.

The publication claimed that the North London club will not force the 29-year-old to make a decision until they have finalised a replacement for Conte.

Eccleshare has now explained that one of the reasons why Spurs hired serial winners in Jose Mourinho and Antonio Conte was to appease Kane and to convince the striker that he does not need to leave in order to work with the game’s elite.

The journalist explains that the England captain would thus have to be convinced that whoever comes through the door this summer is capable of taking the club to silverware.

He thus suggests that Spurs face a ‘dilemma’ over whether to appoint a ‘big-name manager’ to pursue Kane or instead start planning for life after the striker.

Julian Nagelsmann’s appointment would solve both these problems as he is a ‘project manager’ who would play attractive football while also being a big enough name to convince Kane of Tottenham’s ambition.

However, the German might prove quite hard to get and I can see Spurs perhaps turning to someone like Enrique instead of inexperienced options like Kompany or Slot, who perhaps will not be able to persuade Kane to stay.
