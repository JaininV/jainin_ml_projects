MANAMA, April 18 (KUNA) -- Great values for a great month that Allah Almighty singled out in his Holy Book with clear verses from Surat Al-Baqarah, where he honored it by the revelation of the Holy Quran to our Prophet Mohammad (PBUH) and praised its grace as the month of mercy and guidance to people with truth and multiplying the reward through the multiplication of worship act and alms.

Ramadhan in Bahrain has a special spiritual place in people's hearts as it is received with great joy and happiness that is reflected on their faces and celebrated according to the inherited Bahraini tradition.

Preparations for this joyous month start early each year as the local markets see lots of crowds and streets are filled with people until the time of Suhoor to buy foodstuffs, decorations and clothes. Bahraini people are keen on their family gatherings during this holy time to exchange greetings and blessings and also to exchange what is called "Nuqsa" which is a new Bahraini habit to give gifts to express joy and celebrations.

During Ramadhan, the Bahraini table always includes a variety of local and traditional foods and meals such as Althreed, Harees, Kebab and many other delicious dishes.

As the month passes by, children all around Bahrain enjoy "Gergaoun", which is a traditional occasion that people in the GCC celebrate with children as they roam the streets of their neighborhoods and knock on doors for candy and sweets while singing traditional songs.

Every day in Ramadhan, people pray "Al-Taraweeh" after Al-Isha prayer, but on the last ten days of Ramadhan people also pray "Al-Qiyam", which is a prayer held at midnight that has a great amount of "Thawab". (end) bb
