When the COVID-19 pandemic reached the U. S., universities across the country sent students, faculty and staff home â€” along with their devices and other university assets. The University of Cincinnati was no exception, and as this environment became more complex to manage, IT staff decided to tap its student body for help. Standing up a student-run security operations center allows the university to reap the benefits of an enthusiastic workforce and gives these student workers valuable experience that they can take into their post-college careers.
