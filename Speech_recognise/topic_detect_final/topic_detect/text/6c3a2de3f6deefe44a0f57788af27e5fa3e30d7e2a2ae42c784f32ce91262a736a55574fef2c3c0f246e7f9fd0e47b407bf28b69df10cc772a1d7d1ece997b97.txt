Waterfalls, exploring national parks and bird watching are some outdoor activities to do in Minnesota this spring.  Jake Juliot is the PR and Communications Specialist with Explore Minnesota.  He joined me on WJON.  He highlighted the following:

It’s “waterfall season” on the North Shore, when the melting snow causes raging rivers and waterfalls.

* Many North Shore Lodges are offering deals—stay 2 nights, get a third night free – now through about mid-May

* Southern Minnesota has some beautiful waterfalls, too, including at Minneopa State Park and Pipestone National Monument (on the cover of this year’s MN Travel Guide)

Make plans now to visit state and national parks

* Time to ditch the treadmill and the mall walking and get out hiking in the fresh air

* State ParksWhile it may be too early for most people to want to set up a tent, there are lots of other options, including heated camper cabins and yurts and, at Itasca State Park, some pretty nice Four-Season Suites (can you believe they even have flat screen TVs?!).You can make reservations for overnight stays up to 120 days in advance, so if you are a tent camper and want to visit in June or July, now’s the time to grab your spot.
