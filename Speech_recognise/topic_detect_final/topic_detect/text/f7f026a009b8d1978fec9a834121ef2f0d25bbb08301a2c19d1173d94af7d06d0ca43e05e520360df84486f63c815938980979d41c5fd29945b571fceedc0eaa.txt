A 27-year-old motorcyclist has died after a crash in Adelaide's northern suburbs on Tuesday night.

Police and emergency services responded to the serious crash between a motorcycle and a car on Main North Road at Salisbury Heights around 10:30pm.

Police said the motorcycle rider, a 27-year-old man without a fixed address, died at the scene.

The driver of the car was not injured.

The intersection of Main North Road, Saints Road and The Grove Way was closed while Major Crash investigators attended the scene.

The man's death is the 45th life lost on SA roads this year compared with 21 at the same time in 2022.

It was the second fatal road accident on Tuesday, following the death of a 41-year-old cyclist after he was struck by a train at Ascot Park in Adelaide's south.

"Today is the 109th day of the year and we've had 45 lives lost, that's an average of one fatal crash every 2.4 days," Senior Constable Matt Brown told ABC Radio Adelaide's Stacey Lee and Nikolai Beilharz.
