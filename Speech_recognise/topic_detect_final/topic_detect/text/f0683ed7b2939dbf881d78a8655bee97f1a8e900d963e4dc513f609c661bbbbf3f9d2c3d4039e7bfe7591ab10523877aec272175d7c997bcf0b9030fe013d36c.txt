Arjun Tendulkar, scion of former Indian cricketer Sachin Tendulkar, made his much-awaited debut in the IPL season 2023 on Sunday at the Wankhede Stadium against the Kolkata Knight Riders. The 23-year-old left-arm pacer was first acquired by the Mumbai Indians for a sum of Rs. 20 lakh at the IPL 2021 auction, with the Gujarat Titans emerging as the sole competing bidder, leading to an increase in his price to Rs. 30 lakh at the 2022 auction. He was subsequently retained by the Mumbai Indians in the run-up to the mini-auction in December last year. Arjun's tryst with cricket commenced in 2021 when he marked his T20 debut for Mumbai during the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, where he claimed figures of one for 34 in three overs. He then went on to represent Goa in the 2022-23 domestic season and made a triumphant entry into the Ranji Trophy with a sterling century against Rajasthan. During the white-ball season, Arjun emerged as Goa's joint-highest wicket-taker in the Vijay Hazare Trophy, scalping eight wickets in seven matches at an average of 32.37. In the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, he finished as Goa's second-highest wicket-taker with ten wickets in seven games, maintaining an economy rate of 5.69. Arjun has showcased tremendous potential in domestic cricket and his performance in the IPL will be keenly watched by cricket aficionados.
