Abercrombie & Kent has announced it will operate a one-off cruise to the North Pole in 2024 in response to increased demand for expedition voyages.

The luxury operator will charter icebreaker cruise ship Le Commandant Charcot for the 17-day voyage, which departs Oslo on July 12 next year.

The itinerary includes calls at Longyearbyen and Svalbard before five days at sea, after which passengers will reach the North Pole and trek across the ice.

During days at sea, passengers can attend lectures, go stargazing, take polar survival workshops, watch cooking demonstrations and participate in photo competitions.

Stefanie Schmudde, vice-president of product development and operations, said: “As interest in expedition cruising continues to grow, we are continuously looking for new routes and destinations that deliver the thrill of discovery our guests are looking for.

“In 2023, we expanded to all seven countries with Africa, and for 2024 we’re thrilled to ad the North Pole to our portfolio.

“We have taken what not too long ago was a long, arduous expedition and transformed it into a luxury adventure featuring A&K’s expedition team made up of the foremost polar cruising experts, aboard Le Commandant Charcot, one of the world’s most advanced and eco-friendly polar expedition vessels.”
