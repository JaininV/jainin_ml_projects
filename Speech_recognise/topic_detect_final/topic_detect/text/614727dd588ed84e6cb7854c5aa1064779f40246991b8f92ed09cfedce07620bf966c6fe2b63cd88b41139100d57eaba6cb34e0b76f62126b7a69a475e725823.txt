K-Pop idol group SEVENTEEN dropped individual member official photos for the Fallen, Misfit, Lost versions for their tenth mini album, FML. This version showcases the various charms and visuals of each of the 13 members.

The album name, FML, is usually used with a negative connotation for blaming oneself, and SEVENTEEN plans to reinterpret the term into a healthy and positive perspective. On the other hand, the album is set to drop on April 24.
