Nearly 1.6 million refugees from Ukraine have registered in Poland for Temporary Protection. Some registrations were deactivated subsequently, as their holders left Poland for more than 30 days, bringing the number of active PESEL registrations by the end of March to 997,374, according to GoP data (LINK).

UNHCR is supporting government-led efforts through a multisectoral response focusing on ensuring access to asylum and protection, assisting the most vulnerable refugees, and facilitating socio-economic inclusion.

UNHCR and partners are at border crossing points and in refugee-hosting areas to provide information on rights and services, to identify and support vulnerable refugees, to reinforce the reception capacities and support longer-term solutions.
