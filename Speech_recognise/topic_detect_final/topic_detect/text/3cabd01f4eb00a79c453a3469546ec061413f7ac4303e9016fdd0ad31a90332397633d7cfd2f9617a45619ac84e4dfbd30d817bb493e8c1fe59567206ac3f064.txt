PORT ANGELES — A Forks man originally accused of the second-degree murder of his infant daughter has pleaded guilty to first-degree manslaughter and will be sentenced May 24.

Izaiah Calloway was arrested in March 2020 for the murder of his 7-week-old daughter, Faye River Raven Yates, who died at a Tacoma hospital after being assaulted.

Calloway — who was 20 at the time — was accused of assaulting the baby at his home in the 200 block of Fir Avenue in Forks because the baby would not stop crying.

Calloway allegedly slapped Yates, squeezed her and threw the infant against a chair.

On Wednesday, Calloway, now 23, pleaded guilty to the charge of first-degree manslaughter, after initially being charged with second-degree murder and second-degree assault of a child.

According to court documents, the prosecuting attorney will recommend 102 months, or  8½ years, in prison followed by 36 months of community custody with requirements for successful completion of anger management and parenting classes.

Calloway was booked into Clallam County jail on Wednesday after having been released to electronic home monitoring in  January 2022.
