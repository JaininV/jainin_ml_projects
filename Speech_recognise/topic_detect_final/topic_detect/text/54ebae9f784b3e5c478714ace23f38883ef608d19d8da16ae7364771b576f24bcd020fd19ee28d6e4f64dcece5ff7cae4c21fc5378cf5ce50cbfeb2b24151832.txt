A Columbus, Ohio, congressman was forced to resign from a leadership position in the House after making exaggerated claims about his achievements at a top university.

According to the university, Dave Dobos, a West High School alumnus, lied about having attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The Republican attended MIT in the 1970s and majored in economics, though he did not graduate.

He currently represents District 10 in Columbus, as well as portions of Grove City, Urbancrest, and the Far South neighborhood.

Dobos had previously stated on his campaign website, according to the Wayback Machine, that “as a graduate of West High School and MIT, David used his education and training to start a small business.”

The first section of that sentence was gone as of Wednesday afternoon. The Ohio House website now refers to Dobos as having “attended” MIT rather than having received a degree from it.

The American political encyclopedia Ballotpedia.org and a section of the West High School alumni website, however, continued to list Dobos as an MIT alumnus on Wednesday.

“Dave has served on two national committees for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, from which he earned a degree in Economics in 1977,” said the westhighalumni.com website.

Dobos’ resignation from the position of vice chair of the Higher Education Committee was accepted on Tuesday by House Speaker Jason Stephens.
