In Rolls-Royce’s home country of the United Kingdom, Salon Privé is one of the most exclusive concours events. Gathering some of the world’s most exclusive, desirable, and impressive cars together, Rolls-Royce will be presenting two special commissions at the prestigious event: a Phantom Extended Wheelbase, as well as a Ghost. For the Phantom Series II Extended Wheelbase, the Salon Privé event will serve as its public debut in the UK.

Showing off Rolls-Royce’s unmatched ability to create stunning bespoke vehicles, the two vehicles will feature beautiful configurations. The Phantom that will be shown is finished in Belladonna Purple, an elegantly deep but still vibrant shade, and that paintwork will be paired with a black interior with accents in Grace White.

The Ghost that will be shown is finished in Sagano Green with a coachline in Arctic White. Nearly matching the exterior is an interior finished in Serenity Green leather, while the fascia is finished in open-pore Obsidian Ayous. These unique and artful Rolls-Royce commissions are perfect examples of the excellent craftsmanship that the brand is celebrated for and will serve as perfect additions to the Salon Privé lineup.
