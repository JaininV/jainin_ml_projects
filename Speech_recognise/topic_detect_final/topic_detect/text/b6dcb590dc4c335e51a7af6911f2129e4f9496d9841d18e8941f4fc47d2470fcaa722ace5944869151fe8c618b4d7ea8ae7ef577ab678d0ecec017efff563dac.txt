Vyvanse is available as either a capsule or a chewable tablet. With either method, individuals are instructed to take Vyvanse in the morning due to the risk of insomnia associated with taking Vyvanse in the afternoon. Doses are intended to be taken in full, and not divided. While Vyvanse can be taken either with or without food, Dr. Berg notes that “taking it with some food may help reduce the risk of stomach upset.”

Vyvanse capsules can be swallowed whole, or can be opened and added to water, orange juice or yogurt. Any powder that’s become compacted should be broken up with a spoon. If breaking open the capsule, it’s advised to mix the contents until totally dispersed, and to consume the entire mixture immediately rather than storing, according to Dr. Groves.

Those taking chewable tablets should thoroughly chew the tablet prior to swallowing.

“Be sure and talk to your doctor or pharmacist during treatment about any changes in how you feel,” advises Dr. Berg.
