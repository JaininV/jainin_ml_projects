Jeopardy! is all set to return with a new episode on Tuesday, April 18, 2023, bringing back the recently crowned Daniel Ciarrocchi. As fans know, Ben Chan, who was supposed to play his fourth game last night, did not make an appearance because of some health problems, paving way for three new contestants. Ben was the first contestant in weeks with a promising streak. Sadly, fans will now have to wait a while longer to find a champion who finally manages to create a memorable streak.

In the upcoming episode of the game show, Daniel Ciarrocchi, a writer from Baltimore, Maryland, the one-day champion, will face off against Deb Bilodeau, a winemaker from Oakland, California, and Jeremy Felton, a chemist from Cary, North Carolina. Daniel Ciarrocchi won $16,001 on his first day, which is quite a respectable amount. He will surely try to build on this in the upcoming episode.

Jeopardy! is one of the most popular game shows in the world. It originally began in the early 1960s and has since then managed to continue its breathtaking run, becoming one of the most popular shows in the world. Its globe-trotting popularity is primarily because of its engaging nature and offbeat format. Additionally, the final round of the game show is also one of the primary reasons for this immense popularity.
