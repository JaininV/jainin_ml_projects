Put into service Tuesday, the project to upgrade the aircraft's parking area was started last March to raise capacity from 26 to 33 aircraft.

Cam Ranh airport can now receive Airbus A350, ATR aircraft, and those of equivalent sizes thanks to the project, which costs VND712 billion (US$30.4 million) of the Airports Corporation of Vietnam (ACV), the operator of all commercial airports in Vietnam.

According to ACV, the project could have been finished earlier but the construction process encountered many difficulties, including the pandemic and a lack of construction materials due to increased prices.

The airport, a 45-minute driver from Nha Trang beach town, spans 65,000 square meters and serves 6.65 million passengers per year.

It now has a domestic terminal and an international terminal to serve passengers and no cargo terminal, though 14,000 tons of cargo are transported through the airport each year.
