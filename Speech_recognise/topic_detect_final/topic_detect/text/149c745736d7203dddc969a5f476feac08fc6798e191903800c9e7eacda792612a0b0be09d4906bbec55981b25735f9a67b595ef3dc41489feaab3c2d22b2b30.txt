A balcony basket or two might get you a few strawberries or even some fancy flowers this spring, but what if you want to really supplement your produce intake this year?

That’s where Nourish comes in.

A Peterborough-based initiative, part of its mandate is to “give food more importance in our communities, our economy, and our everyday lives.” It oversees more than 40 community gardens in the city and county. This allows residents who don’t have land of their own to plant a garden, reap a harvest, and enjoy food right off the land.

Jillian Bishop of Nourish offers these tips on how the community garden project works in Peterborough:

HOW DO I GO ABOUT GETTING A PLOT OF LAND IN ONE OF THE AREA’S COMMUNITY GARDENS? There are a handful of community gardens in the city and even more as you venture into the county. To get your own plot — most measure about 10 feet by 10 feet — you should call 705-743-3526 ext. 115 or email growing@nourishproject.ca. Nourish staff will work with you to identify options based on your interests and needs. They advise that some gardens may be full. If no plots are available at your preferred garden, they will suggest other gardens with available plots that may be a good fit.

IS THERE A COST INVOLVED IN ATTAINING A PLOT? Costs vary from $5 to $25 for the season, and these contributions help community gardens purchase tools, water systems, soil amendments, etc. But there are other commitments to consider. Upon joining a community garden, all participants are asked to sign a plot holders agreement that outlines the rules and responsibilities for that community garden. Gardeners are expected to:

• Prepare their plots for the planting season throughout the month of May, and have their garden planted by the middle of June.

• Maintain their plot throughout the season, including planting, pruning, weeding, watering, and general maintenance.

• Use the water that is made available in a responsible, eco-friendly manner.

• Have a plan in place for taking holidays. Tell the co-ordinating team and assign a caretaker.

• Contribute to and support communal elements of the community garden, such as pathway weeding and property maintenance.

• Clean their plot, removing all dead plants, annuals, and weeds by the end of the gardening season.

• Stay out of other gardener’s plots, unless given express permission to enter.

Nourish also advises that you do not pick produce from anyone’s plots but your own.

CAN I GROW WHATEVER I WANT? You are expected to follow all municipal bylaws. This includes not planting marijuana, invasive or illegal species, and not using pesticides.

WHAT IF I WANT TO START A NEW COMMUNITY GARDEN IN MY NEIGHBOURHOOD? If a community group would like to start a new community garden on municipal land, the application will be reviewed by Nourish staff, and shared with the City of Peterborough. They will review the application and consider if the location is viable. The city has made a new garden application available on its website.
