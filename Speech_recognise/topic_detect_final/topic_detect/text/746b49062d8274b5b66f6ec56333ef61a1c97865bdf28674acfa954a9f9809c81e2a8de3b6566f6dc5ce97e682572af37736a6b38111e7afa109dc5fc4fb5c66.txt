Hi traders,

The analysis of last week for Bitcoin played out perfect. This pair filled the Fair Value Gap and reacted from the Daily/ 4H supply.

Now it's possible that it makes the last impulsive leg down to break the weak low or a bigger correction down.

Let's see what the market does and react.
