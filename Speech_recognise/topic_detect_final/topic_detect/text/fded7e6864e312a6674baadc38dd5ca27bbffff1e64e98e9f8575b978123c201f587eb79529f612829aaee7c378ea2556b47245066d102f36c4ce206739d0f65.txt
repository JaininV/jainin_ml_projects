Writing and designing are two skills that can complement each other. As someone who loves to express myself through writing, I discovered the joy of combining writing with design, the result has been a fantastic way for me to challenge myself creatively.

In this essay, I’ll describe my creative journey, exploring how I combined my writing skills with my design abilities.

My writing journey began when I started writing about my experiences in trading. As someone who has been interested in this field for a while, I felt like I had a lot to share with others who might be going through similar journeys. Through blog posts and articles, I was able to reflect on my progress and share what I had learned with others.

However, I soon realized that I wanted to do something more with my writing. I didn’t just want to share my thoughts and ideas with others; I wanted to create something that was visually appealing and could convey a message in a different way.

That is when I decided to create a poster on the same topic. I understood Design but ‘Poster Design’ is a new niche for me, but I found it fascinating to experiment with different fonts, colors, and layouts to create something that would catch people’s attention. It was a different kind of storytelling, but one that was just as satisfying as writing.

What I found most interesting was how my writing and design skills complemented each other. As I was creating the poster, I had to think about how to convey a message through both visuals and text. It was a challenge, but the one that I enjoyed.

“Writing is like design. You have to have an idea of what you want to achieve, and then you must execute it with precision and skill.” — Robin Sharma
