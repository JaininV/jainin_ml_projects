Times are hard, and most of us are looking for ways to cut down on the bills. You might be rationing your energy use and thinking twice about using the car or getting that takeaway, but TikToker Cory – @corysworldd – had a flash of inspiration.

“If this actually works, I’m going to consider myself a genius.”

That was quite the ride. TikTok users gave him 10/10 for trying – and for entertaining us all.

I’m imagining someone behind you waiting for the cheese at the salad bar like 😮

You know what I respect the curiosity bc if you don’t try you’ll never know 😎

Emma

This was the best possible ending 😂

Ralph Woofington

I was so gripped all the way, and thought you were onto something smart. You genuinely made me belly laugh so thanks for that 😂 and you are a genius.

YOU ARE JOKING ME, how did I not know that?

We think Cory’s experiment was a massive success for its comedy value alone, but for those who consider it to have fallen down on the cost of the cheese, Krispy_Bacon had a suggestion.

You could’ve got twice the amount of cheese in there. RAM IT IN 😂

The award for the most impractical super-bargain goes to this 44lb chunk of cheese
