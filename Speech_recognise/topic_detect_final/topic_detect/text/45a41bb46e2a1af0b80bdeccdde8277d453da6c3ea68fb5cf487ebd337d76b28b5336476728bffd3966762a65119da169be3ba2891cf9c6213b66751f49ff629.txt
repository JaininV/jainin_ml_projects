Chris Jericho is the man of many gimmicks and near-limitless reinventions over the past three decades. That said, Jericho is often viewed as a petty person who holds grudges for one reason or the other. It is evident that he and CM Punk aren’t on the best of terms and now it appears Jericho seemingly indicated that he wants to throw hands with Punk prior to Punk’s AEW return.

CM Punk is definitely not the most popular guy in the AEW locker room right now, especially after the infamous backstage brawl following AEW All Out. That said, many fans want him to return.

Last month, CM Punk made headlines as he went on a scathing rant on his Instagram story, going after Chris Jericho, Jon Moxley and others. He especially singled out Jericho, calling him a stooge.

It was reported that AEW is trying to plan out CM Punk’s return and that there was a meeting planned between CM Punk and Chris Jericho, to determine whether the two parties can co-exist in the company.

Le Champion recently took to his social media and uploaded a post, where the geo-location was CM Punk’s hometown of Chicago, Illinois. The music he added was ”Sleepwalk My Life Away” by Metallica, which hinted at CM Punk’s Go 2 Sleep move. his caption also indicated that he was seemingly calling out Punk and challenging him to a fight.

Chris Jericho recently claimed that he is not willing to work with CM Punk and he even doubled down on that claim.  CM Punk will return on AEW’s new two-hour show called ‘Collision’ this year, which is likely going to keep Punk and Jericho separate from now on. Regardless, we’ll have to see if Punk and Jericho will mend fences someday.
