The forthcoming Allianz Cup ninth place play-off fixtures between Wasps and DMP Sharks on Saturday 22 April, Twyford Avenue and Sunday 30 April, Northern Echo Arena have been cancelled and will be played as a ‘Friendly Series’ over both the home and away fixtures.

This follows discussions between the RFU and both clubs.

Playing the fixtures as a ‘Friendly Series’ will remove the restriction of additional player eligibility criteria that comes in at the play-off stages of the competition and was putting significant pressure on both clubs to be able to field a team in compliance with the regulations (players must have featured in the pool stages). The decision will allow both clubs to select a squad that can play in meaningful fixtures to support preparations for fulfilling fixtures through the remainder of the league season, without impacting the integrity of the Allianz Cup competition.

With thanks to the RFU
