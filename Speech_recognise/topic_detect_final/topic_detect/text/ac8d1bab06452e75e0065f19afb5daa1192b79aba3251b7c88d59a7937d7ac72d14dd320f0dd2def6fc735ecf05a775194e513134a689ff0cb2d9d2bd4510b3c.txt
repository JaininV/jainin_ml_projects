Ahead of tonight’s game against Real Madrid, Chelsea owner Todd Boehly has urged Chelsea fans to continue backing the team despite the struggles on the pitch this season.

Boehly told El Chiringuito in a live stream: “Have a lot of faith, and we’re gonna win 3-0 tonight. We look at this as a very long-term process, and we have a lot of work to do. We’re excited about the future. The future is bright.”

Boehly took over Chelsea 11 months ago and has spent upwards of £600m ($723m) on new signings.

However, Chelsea have struggled on the pitch despite the massive investments and are 11th in the Premier League.
