How do you greet customers when they arrive?

Recognition of customers is a key component to all businesses. Studies within the Retail sector indicate that if you greet a customer within ten feet and ten seconds – they are more likely to make a purchase within that visit, more likely to recommend your brand to others and will elevate the perception that the customer has of your brand.

With this in mind, wouldn’t it be great if you could greet them as they enter the store on their mobile phones? Or better still welcome them back (if they’re an existing customer) with a greeting stating when they last visited the establishment, or even with tailored promotions based on their purchase history or interests in particular products…
