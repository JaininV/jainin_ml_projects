Golden Pineapple from HydRx is a hybrid strain that was created by crossing Golden Goat with Pineapple Kush.

Users typically describe it as having a tropical flavour and aroma with elements that resemble sour pineapple. This profile is partly the result of it’s dominant terpenes being ocimene, farnesene and limonene. Let’s see how this compares to Flint & Embers Mint Sherbet pre-roll or Collins Ave Blunts.

The HydRx Golden Pineapple pre-rolled blunt is packaged in a plastic tube, which seemed to mask the aroma at first. However, after removing the included cardboard and cotton balls to prevent movement, we were able to detect a faint but distinct scent. The fragrance began with a hint of grass from the Golden Goat lineage before giving way to a more prominent tropical citrusy note. Surprisingly, the aroma was more noticeable from the tube itself than the actual blunt.

The Golden Pineapple blunt arrived in a standard black plastic tube, with the label displaying all necessary information including the brand name, product name, THC and CBD levels, product type, weight, contact details, packaged date, and lot number. Upon opening the tube, a cotton ball sits on top, followed by a reusable glass filter connected to the hand-rolled blunt. Wrapped in a natural cigar-coloured hemp leaf and filled with Golden Pineapple strain, the blunt rests in a cardboard sleeve at the bottom of the tube, cushioned by another cotton ball. The flower was kept firmly in place, thanks to a well-stamped end and overall this was one of the more impressive pre-roll presentations we have come across.

The blunt was tightly packed, which made it difficult to achieve proper airflow once we got it lit. Even after lighting it required several long, slow puffs to ensure smooth airflow and to fully appreciate the full taste. The intensity of the flavour was consistent with the aroma – not too strong, but present. Initially the profile was a mix of grassy and citrus notes, with the grassy flavour being slightly more dominant. However, on exhale, we noticed a sharp shift towards a tangy citrus note that lingered in the throat. The smoke was fairly smooth as well with minimal coughing while enjoying.

Our pre-rolled blunt was packaged on October 29, 2022, and belonged to lot number PR221024A023. With a price of $16.50 and THC content of 22.4%, it was clear this was a high-quality product for certain occasions. The extra attention given to the packaging, such as the inclusion of cotton balls and a cardboard sleeve to prevent the blunt from moving during transportation, as well as the use of a reusable glass filter tip, showed that care had been taken in the production process. After smoking we felt alert but with a scattered mental focus combined with a groggy sleepy eyes sensation. The pure hemp wrap burned evenly, however, we did have some difficulty with airflow due to the tight packing of the blunt. Despite this, the flavour was consistent and pleasant throughout leaving us satisfied overall with HydRx’s Golden Pineapple pre-rolled blunt.
