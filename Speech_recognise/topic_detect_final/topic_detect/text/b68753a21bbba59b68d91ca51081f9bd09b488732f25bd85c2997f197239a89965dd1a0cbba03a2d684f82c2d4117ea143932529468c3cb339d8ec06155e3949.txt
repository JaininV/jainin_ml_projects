I’ve been a pretty big fan of the show Westworld. If you’re not familiar with the premise, it’s a story about an immersive world of artificially intelligent robots or “hosts” and their interactions with the human race.

Any futurist would find the plot compelling. It showcases both hardware and software advancements that seem just far enough out of our current reality but could be obtainable in the not-so-distant future. One of the key components of the show is programming the intelligence of the hosts in order to seem realistic while still being safe and repeatable.
