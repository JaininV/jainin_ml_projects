When asked which of Virat Kohli and AB De Villiers he would like as a better opening partner, legendary West Indian cricketer Chris Gayle chose Virat Kohli as his preferred batting partner over fellow Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) ‘Hall of Famer’ AB de Villiers. Gayle and AB de Villiers were both inducted into the RCB’s ‘Hall of Fame’ recently.

Gayle started the batting with Kohli multiple times during his stay with the team, and the tandem helped RCB win several games. He also collaborated with de Villiers on some noteworthy hits. Gayle explained on Jio Cinema why he chose Virat as his preferred batting partner.

“I opened the batting more with Virat, so I’m going to pick Virat,” Gayle said.

The three of Kohli, Gayle, and de Villiers last played for RCB in 2017, when the West Indian was released ahead of the 2018 mega auctions and purchased by Punjab Kings. Kohli is the only current player among the three, as de Villiers retired last year and Gayle played his final IPL match in 2021.

De Villiers played 157 games for the team between 2011 and 2021. He scored 4,522 runs at a 41.10 average. He had a strike rate of more than 158 and scored two centuries and 37 fifties for the team. Gayle, on the other hand, played 91 matches for RCB from 2011 to 2017, amassing 3,420 runs at a strike rate of over 154, five centuries, and 21 half-centuries. His highest possible score is 175*.

So far in the IPL 2023, RCB has won two matches and lost their most recent encounter to CSK on Monday by a margin of only eight runs.
