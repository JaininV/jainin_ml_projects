Sam Roberts of “Notsam Wrestling” recently shared his thoughts on this year’s WWE Money in the Bank pay-per-view event.

Roberts declared that there are plenty of reasons to have Logan Paul win the briefcase at this year’s show in London.

Paul has proved to be a huge draw for WWE thanks to his stardom and the ability to evoke emotions among the audience.

According to Roberts, Paul’s qualities make him the ideal candidate to win the Men’s Money In The Bank match this year.

You can check out some highlights from Sam’s TikTok video below:

On why Paul should win MITB this year: “This is a man, who while holding the briefcase, would have the WWE held hostage because the idea of him being WWE Champion is so antithetical to what the WWE Universe wants. In 2023, the person who should hold the Money in the Bank briefcase is Logan Paul.”

On how WWE’s investment in Paul informs the situation: “Logan Paul is in this position now where he’s had big matches. He’s proven what he can do. Logan Paul has to operate at a top level in order to be worth the investment that’s being made in Logan Paul. So how do you operate up there? You have him go to this pay-per-view and win the Money in the Bank briefcase.”

@notsamrobertsFor me, this is the best pick for MITB this year. From NotsamWrestling wwe wwemitb moneyinthebank loganpaul wrestling samroberts notsam
