STARKVILLE - Mississippi State (21-15, 4-10 SEC) will look to take the series from Ole Miss (20-15, 3-11 SEC) today in a rubber game at Dudy Noble Field. The Rebels won the series opener with a strong pitching performance 3-2. The Saturday game had its share of dramatics. Ole Miss rallied to take the lead in the 9th only to see State come back to walk it off on a Dakota Jordan two RBI single. Today is a new day and both teams have a chance to right the ship in some respects. The Bulldogs won the road series at Alabama, but Ole Miss has not won an SEC weekend the entire season. State will look to extend the Rebels' streak of futility. The Diamond Dawgs are 19-6 in the last 25 against the instate rivals.Mississippi State will send freshman Jurrangelo Cijntje (3-2, 5.76 ERA) to the mound. The talented newcomer has struggled in SEC play for the most part and will look to get things back on track today. Cijntje has struckout 41 and walked 22. Opponents are hitting just .198 against him. Recruited as a both handed pitcher Cijntje has pitched exclusively from the right side the last two weeks. It will be interesting if that trend continues today.Coach Mike Bianco has announced that freshman righthander JT Quinn (3-0, 5.18 ERA). Quinn was recently inserted into the SEC rotation. With 33 innings of college work under his belt, Quinne has struckout 36 and walked 16. Opponents have been able to put the ball in play this season. Opponents are hitting .228 against him.
