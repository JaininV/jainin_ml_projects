Leeds United have reportedly joined the race to sign RC Lens striker Lois Openda, who in his first year in France is enjoying a record-breaking campaign.

According to Foot Mercato, the Whites are the latest side to join the race for the 23-year-old forward, who this season has already hit 15 goals in Ligue 1, breaking the single-season record for a Lens player as well as hitting the fasted hat-trick in the division this century.

As a result, interest has spiked in Openda ahead of Lens incredible run for a UEFA Champions League finish, with the French side believed to value their star striker at €30m (£27m), a fee that could tempt Leeds into signing the Belgian international this summer.

Should the Whites survive relegation, Openda could emerge as a tantalising option for Leeds, though with Lens on course to finish in a European spot and clubs such as AC Milan and Eintracht Frankfurt also eyeing the youngster, the Yorkshire side could be in trouble.

Indeed, whilst the Premier League would be alluring, as well as Leeds’ ability to match Lens’ asking price, Openda himself might not be too sold on a move to Elland Road given their latest dabble at fighting off relegation and the size of other clubs looking for his signature.

As a result, Leeds could struggle to bring in Openda, even if they do survive to live as a Premier League team for another day. And given the pull clubs like Milan and Frankfurt have, the Whites might be out of their depth in their latest transfer battle for a top talent.

Leeds have always been a club to punch above their weight when it comes to marquee signings, and Openda could prove to be no different, with the Belgian star a player who could lead the line for the Whites for years to come having enjoyed a brilliant year in France.

And as a result, Leeds could pull off one of the deals of the summer if they somehow manage to beat the likes of Milan to Openda’s signature, with the Yorkshire side well aware that they will face a difficult challenge to bring in the attacker with interest set to explode in the coming weeks.
