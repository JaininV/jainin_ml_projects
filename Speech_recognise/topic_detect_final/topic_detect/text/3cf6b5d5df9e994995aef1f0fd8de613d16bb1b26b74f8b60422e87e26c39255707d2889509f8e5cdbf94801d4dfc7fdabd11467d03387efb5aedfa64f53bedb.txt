Israeli security forces on Wednesday arrested a 15-year-old Palestinian who suspected of shooting and wounding two Israelis in the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah a day earlier.

The suspect, a resident of the Askar refugee camp near Nablus is being interrogated by the Shin Bet security services, the Israeli army said in a statement.

Two men aged 48 and 50 were lightly and moderately wounded on Tuesday. The suspect shot at them while they sat inside a car as they were leaving the Tomb of Simeon the Just in Sheikh Jarrah. They were taken to hospitals in the city for treatment.

Earlier on Tuesday, the police had found the gun used in the attack – an improvised submachine gun common in the West Bank – known as a Carlo.

Israel's police chief Kobi Shabtai commended the security forces on the arrest on Wednesday and said that the police were able to prevent eight terror attacks during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.

The Tomb of Simeon the Just is located within Shimon HaTzadik, a small settler enclave in Sheikh Jarrah. Israeli settlers first started to occupy several homes in the neighborhood in the 2000s, enabled by legal proceedings carried out by private, settler-affiliated real estate companies to evict the area’s Palestinian residents.

Hamas’s Jerusalem spokesperson welcomed the attack and said it’s a “natural reaction to the crimes of the occupation, especially ones in Jerusalem and in the Al-Aqsa mosque.” He congratulated “resistance fighters” who are dealing with the “arrogant enemy” and called for East Jerusalem’s Palestinians to protect the “hero” who carried out the attack. He concluded by warning Israel of its “continued aggression.”
