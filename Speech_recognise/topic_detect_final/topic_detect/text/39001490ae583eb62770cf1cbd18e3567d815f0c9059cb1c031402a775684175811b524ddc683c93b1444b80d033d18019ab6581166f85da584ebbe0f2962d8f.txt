Kevin Durant recorded his first playoff win the Suns as his team defeated the Clippers in Game 2 of the first round series. The two-time NBA champion played 44 minutes and scored 25 points along with 6 rebounds and 5 assists.

Devin Booker was asked after the game if this win was needed to prove that Phoenix can win with KD on the roster.

“That’s a two-time champ, a two-time Finals MVP,” Booker said about Durant. “He’s proven enough. We didn’t lose any games with each other during the regular season and we just dropped Game 1.

“Just wanted to come out and respond. Like you said, spacing is a big part of that. He’s so talented you just have to let him work.”
