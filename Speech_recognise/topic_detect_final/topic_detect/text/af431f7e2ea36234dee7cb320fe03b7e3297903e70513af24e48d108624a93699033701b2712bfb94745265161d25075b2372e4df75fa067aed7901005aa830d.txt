If there’s such a thing as a heritage brand for consumer GPS, surely Garmin would be that. With their Instinct 2X Solar, Garmin flaunts a seriously muscular GPS smartwatch. Comparing it to most soft-lined smartwatches on the market is like looking at the M1a2 Abrams military tank next to a balloon animal rendition of the Michelin Man.

More than looks, it’s certified with the military specification, MIL-STD-810, for performance under extreme circumstances, including shock and heat.

The workout and sports apps give you all the equation, from tracking recovery time to an actual indicator for expected performance. The flashlight and safety tracking make it a contingency plan on your wrist. This watch is crammed with functions effective for training, understanding your body better, or just having a useful and entertaining gadget.
