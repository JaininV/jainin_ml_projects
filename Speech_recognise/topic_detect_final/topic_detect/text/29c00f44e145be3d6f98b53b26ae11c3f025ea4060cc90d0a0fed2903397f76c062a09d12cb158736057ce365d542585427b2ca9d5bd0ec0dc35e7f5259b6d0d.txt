I'm not sure where crack dips get their name, but they certainly are tasty. I've also heard this dip called Mexican corn dip or cowboy corn sip also.

Whatever you call it, it's delicious! All that cheese and bacon, with the spice of jalape√±o to keep things interesting. This crack corn dip is absolutely one of my favorite dip recipes and it is always the first appetizer devoured at parties.
