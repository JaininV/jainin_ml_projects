If you lived in New York City in the 1960s and into the 1980s, you would remember the radio stations, WABC and WCBS, along with its legendary Disk Jockey Bruce Morrow, better known to all of us as "Cousin Brucie." Bruce Morrow was the preeminent Radio Personality of his generation, introducing to the public the future hits of the 60s and 70s and later on, in the 80s, keeping the oldies music relevant and alive. He is a member of The National Radio Hall of Fame and The National Association of Broadcasters Hall of Fame.

Bayside Historical Society is paying tribute to "The Cousin Brucie Era" with a weekend-long tribute to the music of the 60s, 70s and 80s.
