For the schnitzel, season cutlets with salt and pepper.

Combine panko with fine breadcrumbs, cumin, caraway, garlic, lemon zest, ginger and nutmeg in a shallow pan.

Combine flour with white pepper in another pan.

Line up a breading station near your stove: flour, egg and breadcrumb mixture.

Heat about Â¼ inch of oil in large skillet over medium to medium-high heat and set up a wire rack-lined pan to drain schnitzel.

Coat chicken two at a time in flour, egg and breadcrumbs and fry to deep golden brown, 5 minutes or so, turning once. Drain on wire rack and repeat. Serve with lemon wedges and sweet and sour cabbage (below).

For the cabbage, heat oil, two turns of the pan, in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Melt in butter, add the onions and soften. Add bay and juniper, toss cabbage into pot with salt and pepper and cook for a minute. Add garlic, vinegar, chicken broth and brown sugar, partially cover the pot and cook cabbage for 20 minutes, or until tender. Add chili crisp and dill and serve.
