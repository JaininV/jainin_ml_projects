While the Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster PS4 games won’t be out until April 19, 2023, the trophies for all six were revealed. There are a substantial number to earn for each entry in the series. However, now that the official lists are live, we also know that every Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster PS4 game includes one Platinum trophy. [Thanks, Exophase via Gematsu!]

As is common in these situations, you need to earn every other trophy in the game to unlock the Platinum. The number varies depending on the game. Final Fantasy only features 24 trophies total. Final Fantasy V has the most at 39 trophies when someone gets through it all.

Here’s the full list of how many trophies are available in each of the six Final Fantasy games, including the Platinum in every one. Some of them involve reaching certain points in the stories. Others can involve acquiring certain items or hitting milestones.

Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster will come to the PS4 and Nintendo Switch on April 19, 2023. The games are already available on the PC and mobile devices.
