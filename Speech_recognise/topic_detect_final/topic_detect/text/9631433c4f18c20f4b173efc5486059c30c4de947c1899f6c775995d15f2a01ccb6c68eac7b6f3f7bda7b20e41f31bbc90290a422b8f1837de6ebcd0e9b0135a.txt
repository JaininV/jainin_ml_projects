ERLANGER, Ky. — The Enzweiler Building Institute of the Building Industry Association of Northern Kentucky (BIA) conferred certificates at its graduation ceremony April 13. Thirty- seven skilled tradespeople graduated from the institute during their commencement for the 2022-2023 school year.

The ceremony was highlighted by a commencement speech by Covington Mayor Joseph Meyer. Additionally, the night included an address by Ben Taylor, division president of Drees Homes, and immediate past president of the Building Industry Association of Northern Kentucky. Drees Homes was the graduation sponsor for the evening.

During the commencement ceremony Eddie Luckey, 2nd year heating, venting and air-conditioning student, was named Student of the Year by the Institute. Luckey was selected based on his perfect attendance, his enthusiasm for the industry, and his desire to introduce others to the skilled trades.

“Achieving perfect attendance in a program like ours is no small feat. Our students work all day – typically with start times in the early morning – and then come to school from 6 to 9 p.m. throughout the year. Eddie not only had perfect attendance, but he was always excited to be in class and eager for the night’s assignments,” said Director of Professional Development Vicki Berling.

The list of graduates with their city of residence by program is as follows:
