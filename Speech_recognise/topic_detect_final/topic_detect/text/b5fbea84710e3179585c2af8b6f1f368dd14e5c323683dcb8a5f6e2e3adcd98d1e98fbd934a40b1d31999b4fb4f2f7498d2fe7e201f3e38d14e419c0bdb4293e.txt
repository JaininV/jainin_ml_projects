Alan Hutton has claimed Ryan Kent will stay at Rangers and Alfredo Morelos will be allowed to leave for free.

Speaking exclusively to Football Insider, the former Gers defender said that although he would love the club to hold on to both players, the situation with Morelos is too far gone.

The pair are out of contract this summer and could leave for free, with neither having agreed a new deal.

Football Insider revealed that the Gers are hopeful of agreeing a new contract with Kent amid interest from Vincent Kompany’s Burnley.

Manager Michael Beale considers the winger a key player at Ibrox and is keen to keep hold of him next season.

On 6 March, sources told this site that relegation threatened Leeds United have also registered their interest in the playmaker ahead of the summer.

Earlier this month (3 April), Football Insider revealed that Morelos, 26, had not reached an agreement with Galatasaray despite reports but is attracting interest from clubs in Turkey and around Europe.

But Hutton insisted Kent is the one who will stay.

“I have always said Kent would stay and I still believe that he will,” he told Football Insider.

“Can he improve? Of course he can. He has got all the ability and he probably should be scoring more goals, creating more opportunities. So I think there is room for improvement.

“Morelos has got better as the weeks have gone on but he has had a big dip in form as the weeks have gone on for whatever reason. I think if one is to go I think he will be the one.

“Ultimately you want to keep all your best players. I just wonder if it is too far down the line for the likes of Morelos.

“Kent did have a lot of interest but that has cooled given recent performances. I still think Kent will stay and Morelos will go.“
