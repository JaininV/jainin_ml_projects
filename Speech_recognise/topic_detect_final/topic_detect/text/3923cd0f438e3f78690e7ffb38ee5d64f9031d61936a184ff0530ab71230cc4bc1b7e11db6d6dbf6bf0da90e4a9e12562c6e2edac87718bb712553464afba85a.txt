As hip-hop celebrates its 50th anniversary, Warner Music Group’s creative content division WMX has announced Iconic Records, a brand-new visual podcast series that will highlight iconic albums in pop culture. First on the list is The Notorious B. I.G.’s posthumous album Life After Death, which host Angie Martinez will delve into for the series’ debut season.

She’ll speak to the likes of Lil Cease, Fat Joe, Pusha T, Rick Ross, Too $hort and some surprise guests about making the album, its legacy and Big’s overall impact on hip-hop, with some exclusive stories shared along the way.

“Biggie was, and still is, one of the most important artists of our lifetime and Life After Death is a masterpiece!” Martinez said in a statement. “To collaborate with WMX on this series has been an incredible experience. It’s especially meaningful as we also pay homage to 50 years of hip-hop and how it’s changed the course of history.”

Martinez and Kevin Hofman executive-produced Iconic Records: Life After Death, while Bonsu Thompson and the estate of Christopher Wallace co-directed the eight-episode series.

Life After Death will premiere April 29 at 8 p.m. ET on WMX’s new hip-hop channel on The Roku Channel, and will also be available to watch on Big’s YouTube Channel. Those who prefer an audio experience can stream on major podcast platforms starting May 1.
