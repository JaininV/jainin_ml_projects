To share his bed with another man?! Trevor Harris is not happy that his stepbrother Ryder Owens will be sleeping next to him, day after day, every day. It’s one of the things Trevor Harris can’t accept. In his father’s small house, there are now two other people – his stepbrother Ryder Owens and Ryder’s mother.

Trevor still hasn’t gotten used to the idea of having a new family, and having Ryder in his room literally pisses Trevor off. He can’t stand Ryder, who is there all the time, showing total disrespect to his stepbrother…

But nothing in this world is final, including the situation with the two stepbrothers. One night Ryder Owens gets a boner and decides to jerk off in bed right next to his stepbrother. Trevor Harris is furious when he sees how cocky Ryder is, but then he realizes how cute he is and the twist happens and they have sex. Trevor Harris would hardly want Ryder Owens to stay away from him any longer.
