IRGC Commander Major General Hossein Salami and a number of other senior IRGC generals met Army Commander Major General Abdolrahim Mousavi on Wednesday to congratulate him on the National Army Day.

In the gathering, Major General Salami described the IRGC and the Army as two sturdy pillars of Iran’s defense power, saying the two forces’ integrity, solidarity, unity, cordial interaction and unbreakable fraternity signify the Islamic Republic’s great military power that paves the way for victory over the enemies.

For his part, Major General Mousavi lauded the unparalleled rapport between the Army and the IRGC. He said while the enemy has mounted pressures and resorted to psychological war in order to create division, such unity among the Iranian Armed Forces has thwarted the enemy’s plots and frustrated its hopes.

The commander also pointed to the Army’s great advances, saying its young experts have managed to design and manufacture all types of defense equipment inside the country.

In a meeting with a group of top military commanders in Tehran on Sunday, Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei called on the Iranian Armed Forces to keep enhancing their preparedness in all areas and do not cease making progress because the threats of the enemies will never fade away.
