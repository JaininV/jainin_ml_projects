"Why I'd pick my baby over my wife during birth complications" - Man reveals

A man has sparked controversy online as he says he'd choose his child over his wife during birth complications.

The man identified as @Chimaszn said that in a situation where the life of his wife and newborn are both hanging by a thread during childbirth, he'd choose to save his child.

@Chimaszn revealed this while reacting to a post in which a female Twitter user said that in a situation of birth complications, the doctor should save her and not the newborn.

According to @Chimaszn he'd tell them to save both his wife and child; if, however, that option isn't viable, he'd choose his child.

"I'd tell them to save both and if they can't, then I have no choice than to go for the baby. can't leave my blood to go that way."

Check out some reactions his reply garnered:

We already know how busy and absent fathers are."
