Star Entertainment Group has announced it will axe 500 positions and implement a salary and incentives freeze to extract $100 million from its costs following unprecedented low earnings across its casinos.

The embattled casino group released a trading update to the ASX on Wednesday, which revealed it now expects to post underlying earnings of between $280 million and $310 million this financial year following a rapid decline in trading over the past couple of months. The downgrade pertains to Star Entertainment’s 2023 financial results and is separate to previously announced financial headwinds, which relate to a controversial poker machine tax rise that the NSW government may introduce in July.

“The group is experiencing a significant and rapid deteriorating in operating conditions, particularly at The Star Sydney and Star Gold Coast.

This has largely been driven by the compounding impact of regulatory operating restrictions and exclusions, and by emerging weaknesses in consumer discretionary spending behaviour,” The Star said.
