One of the first Kosas products recommended to me when the brand launched in the UK was the lip oil. I have to say, they are absolutely lovely. Here’s the lowdown on the Kosas Wet Lip Oil Gloss with photos and swatches.

There are a range of shades available to choose from:

I have five of the shades to show you – Exposed, Unzipped, Bare:

I absolutely love the texture of this lip gloss. Although it is called a lip oil, it has the texture of a beautifully hydrating lip gloss, and it is brilliant for delivering a super flattering wash of colour and a lovely plumped up look.

It makes my lips look super soft and smooth, and I have to say, I love every shade I have tried. My favourites are Unzipped, Bare and Revealed.

The formula is really lovely and it just feels so comfortable without any stickiness. You can go for a light layer to gives the lips a soft sheen, or layer it up for high shine and a more intense colour.

If you want the shine to last more than a few hours, you will need to reapply, however, I am happy with this because it is such a nourishing formula. My only negative comment is that the one I have been carrying around in my handbag, Unzipped, is leaking a little at the neck of the tube. It hasn’t leaked out into my bag, but it just looks a bit messy. I can deal with it though!
