Today Gearbox Publishing and Gunfire Games released a new trailer of their upcoming game Remnant 2.

The trailer focuses on one of the archetypes included in the game, the handler. As the name suggests, the handler fights with a dog companion that can be customized via behaviors to tank, heal, or attack, also granting corresponding buffs to the whole team.

The Kinship trait also reduces all friendly fire, which helps a lot if you like to spray and pray or use explosive weaponry around your companions. Incidentally, the dog can't die. If its HP gets depleted, it'll just lay down until it receives its due tribute in the form of affection and encouragement from the handler.

We already saw the handler in action in a previous trailer focusing on the dog, and now you can see the new one below.

If you're unfamiliar with Remnant 2, it's the sequel to Remnant: From the Ashes, mixing melee and ranged combat with exploration, challenging enemies, and epic boss battles. While it's a Souls-like action-adventure RPG, it comes with an interesting twist. Instead of fighting exclusively with melee weapons and spells, players have an arsenal of firearms at their disposal, which is definitely a departure from the tropes created by most Souls games.

The game will release in the summer of 2023 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. if you'd like to see more, you can check out another trailer showing off the game's eerie's but beautiful world.
