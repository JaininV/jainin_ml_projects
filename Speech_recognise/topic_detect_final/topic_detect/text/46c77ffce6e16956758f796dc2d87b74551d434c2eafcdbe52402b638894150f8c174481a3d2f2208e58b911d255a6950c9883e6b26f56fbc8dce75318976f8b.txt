There’s nothing more fun and relaxing than getting to spend an extended amount of time designing a super detailed set of nails. But if you don’t have the right products, the experience can be frustrating—and turn into a mess. Fortunately, no nail tech will ever hesitate to recommend the products that get them the best results.

Nail artist and winner of NTNA Season 2 Lavette Cephus (@beaute_asylum) feels this way about Gelish, a gel nail brand that provides her the ability to get the most out of its products when meticulously hand painting stunning nail designs. You need products of a high quality to paint the way she likes to. See why she trusts Gelish to help her create the most involved designs.

Cephus is easily able to achieve a painterly woodgrain effect on this set of nails. The matte top coat completes the illusion of a wood surface. She used Gelish’s Art form Gels in black, a product that gives you the utmost control when creating art on nails, to paint the wood texture and the hearts.

This design would make anyone hungry! The richness of the neutral brown and beige palette already reminds of chocolate, not to mention the delicious-looking truffles that Cephus hand painted on each nail. Gelish has literally any color you may need to create the art you’re picturing in your head.

If you’re looking for a high-quality gel brand that is reliable enough to last and offers you enough control to paint your intricate nail designs, look no further than Gelish. And for all your lacquer needs, Morgan Taylor has you covered.
