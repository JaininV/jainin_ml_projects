Looker babe Shivaleeka Oberoi can waltz, perfectly attired, onto your Instagram timeline and put some of your most fashionable pics to shame.

Her bindaas fashion, and the chirpy running commentary she supplies with it, is one of the many reasons she is so loved by her 2.2 million followers on the social-media, photo-sharing app.

The Mumbai girl is the thief of their hearts, a 'glow-getter' and has got 'drama in her veins'.

The Yeh Saali Aashiqui and Khuda Haafiz actor feels she belongs to the sea and wants to 'beam like the happiest rainbow you have ever spotted'.

'Just a happy girl in her world', her style choices remind you that she prefers to be 'a black and white person living in a colourful world'. Kyon?
