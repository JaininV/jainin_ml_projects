WHAT DOES THE BIBLE SAY ABOUT 'APPOINTMENT OF DEATH'?

In the Bible, the concept of death is mentioned frequently, and there are several passages that refer to death as an appointment or an inevitable event that will happen to every person.

Here are some verses and explanations:

Hebrews 9:27 - "And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment."

This verse emphasizes that death is an appointment that every human being will have to face. The phrase "appointed unto men" suggests that death is a predetermined event that will happen to everyone. The second part of the verse also implies that there will be a judgment after death, which could be interpreted as either a positive or negative outcome depending on one's beliefs and actions.

Ecclesiastes 3:2 - "A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted."

This verse is part of a larger passage in Ecclesiastes that describes the cyclical nature of life. The phrase "a time to die" suggests that death is an inevitable part of life, just as birth is. The passage as a whole suggests that there is a time for everything, including both life and death.

Job 14:5 - "Seeing his days are determined, the number of his months are with thee, thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass."

This verse speaks of the idea that our lives are limited and predetermined by God. The phrase "his days are determined" suggests that our lifespan is predetermined by a higher power, and we cannot exceed the bounds that have been set for us. This verse could be interpreted as suggesting that death is a predetermined appointment that we cannot avoid.

Psalm 139:16 - "Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect; and in thy book all my members were written, which in continuance were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them."

This verse speaks of the idea that God has a plan for each individual's life, including the time of their death. The phrase "in thy book all my members were written" suggests that God has recorded every detail of our lives, including the time of our death. This verse could be interpreted as suggesting that death is a part of God's plan for each person.

Overall, these verses and others in the Bible suggest that death is an appointment that every human being will have to face, and that our lifespan and the time of our death are predetermined by a higher power. The Bible offers comfort and hope to believers by suggesting that there is life beyond death, and that those who have faith will be rewarded in the afterlife.
