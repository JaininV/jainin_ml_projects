Lucio Marin was in the third grade at Lincoln-Jackson Elementary School in 1995 when a time capsule was buried on the grounds.

“I’ll be honest, it was 28 years ago, so I don’t remember what was put in there, but I know everybody who was there put something in there,” Marin said.

Marin said he remembers there were music cassettes, pogs (a popular toy of the day), some people wrote notes to their future selves and other items.

“I just know it was a big event for the school,” Marin said. “We were going to open it up in 2020 but COVID happened.

In 1995, Cathleen Mazur, a young student teacher, took on a time capsule project under the direction of principal Delman Shirley and secretary Bestella Gardner. She guided the entire school, as students and staff all prepared items to be buried in the time capsule in hopes to be dug up again 25 years later in the year 2020.

A ceremony to dig up that time capsule is set for 10 a.m. Saturday at the school at the intersection of Grand Avenue and Alphon Street.
