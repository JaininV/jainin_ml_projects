IRISH star Clodagh McKenna's fans go wild for the unique and jaw-dropping dress she wore on This Morning.

The Cork chef was back on the ITV show along with Rochelle Humes and Phillip Schofield to cook a delicious meal.

She made spring salmon rice and she looked stunning on the show in a green and white checkered dress.

The dress had a plunging neckline and buttons on the front with a flowing skirt.

She paired this with some gold jewellery and had her hair up in a ponytail.

Clodagh revealed she got the dress from Nobody's Child and it's on the website for €118.

The TV star captioned the picture saying: "Good morning. See you all on @thismorning @itv soon! I’m cooking a Spring Salmon Rice at 12pm.

Fans and friends of Clodagh flocked to her Instagram comment section as they went wild for the beautiful dress.

Aileen commented saying: "You look the epitome of Spring in this pic."

Rita said: "Lovely dress ( and it's got pockets!)"

One follower wrote: "Stunning outfit as always!"

Tanya gushed: "Looking forward to it Clodagh. You look fabulous."

While Erika also commented saying: "Gorgeous springtime dress."

This comes after Clodagh recently said her husband is the "kindest and most loving person" on his birthday.

The This Morning chef married Harry Herbert, the late Queen's godson, in front of a star-studded guest list at Highclere Castle in 2021.

Harry recently celebrated his birthday and the Cork native took to her Instagram to share an adorable post for his birthday.

In the picture, Harry was sitting town with the couple's two dogs in a garden.

Harry, who lives in Highclere Castle with Clodagh, was sporting a navy suit jacket, blue shirt and some jeans.

He had a huge grin on his face as he faced his wife behind the camera.

Clodagh captioned the snap saying: "Happy Birthday to my darling husband Harry.

"The kindest and most loving person in this world.

"Love you to the moon and back @harry_m_herbert."
