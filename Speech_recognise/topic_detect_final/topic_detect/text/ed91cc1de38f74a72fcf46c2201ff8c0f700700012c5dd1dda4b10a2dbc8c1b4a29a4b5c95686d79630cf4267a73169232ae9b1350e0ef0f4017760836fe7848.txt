Choose multi-functional items with a long shelf life made from sturdy, solid materials, says Noah Morse, co-founder and director of product design and development for Vancouver furniture retailer Sundays.   Cosy seating is a must, and will become a go-to reading spot for years to come, says Morse. A swivel chair is a better option than a traditional recliner in terms of durability.  Sundays’ Flip Me Chair is a good example of products that grow with your child, he says. It’s designed to function as a small table, seat or shelf, so it is useful regardless of their size, he says.   Carmen Ciesielski is director of home furnishing and design for Ikea Canada and agrees with this sentiment.

“We love products and storage that can be personalized and adapted as your child grows,” she says.  An example of this at Ikea is their Smussla bedside table that adjusts to different-sized beds, so it works as your children get older, says Ciesielski.  Decide on your style, and choose colours to match  When it comes to choosing colours for kids’ rooms, Emily Yewchuk of Wildflower Mercantile says she always starts with a design concept or style.  A garden-inspired room for a little girl might feature enchanting floral wallpaper, fairy art prints, and carefully coordinated colours and textures, she says. “Drawing inspiration from the natural world, such as the hues of an English garden or the colours of Oahu, can help me identify captivating colour schemes.”

Yewchuk loves to mix colours and textures in bedding and accessories that create an engaging, dynamic space that is both visually appealing and comfortable.  She suggests keeping the walls and bedding relatively neutral or using solid colours and playful accents like pillows, books, and artwork to introduce a burst of personality.  Morse agrees: “A neutral colour palette provides a soothing background and also grounds the room to allow you to add pops of colour and print through accessories.”    Remember to make room for play because everyone benefits from it, says Ciesielski. Play is essential to children’s development, helping them learn about themselves and the world. In addition, it’s an incredible creativity booster and stress reliever.

“The list of benefits goes on: play develops communication skills and problem-solving, it makes us more flexible and optimistic, and that’s not even the half of it,” says Ciesielski.      Go for open shelving and plenty of storage in kids’ rooms.  /   Morse says items like rugs with intriguing patterns and encouraging interaction are also great.  Both Sundays and Ikea offer a range of rugs and play mats designed for children. Sundays’ Checkers Rug x Scott Sueme adds some pattern, personality, and colour into a space without being overbearing, while Ikea has the Plufsig folding gym mat that’s ideal for tumbles and somersaults.     Open shelves work as a great way to personalize a child’s room and add easy-access storage at the same time, giving them the freedom to play safely and independently, says Ciesielski.   “Try labelling storage boxes with pictures so it’s easy to identify what’s inside,” she suggests.   Morse recommends opting for a mirror that helps open up your space, as it can make a small space feel bigger.      Mirrors are a great way to make spaces feel bigger than they are.  /   As a final note, Ciesielski stresses the importance of safety. Home is one of the most important playgrounds for children, and their safety must always be a top priority, she says: “Every child has the right to a safe home environment.”           The Home Front: B.
