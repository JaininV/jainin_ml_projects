Frontman Benji recalls that the track was inspired by lockdown and how much he hated 2020 and the effect it had on the world. “On the other hand, 2023 is a different story,” he says. “We’ve released new music and we’re still to drop another few monsters from our album ‘Smile’. We’ve got the KISS tour coming, and we’ve also got our headline tour supporting the new album. So 2023, to me, looks like a very exciting time to be in Skindred. I’m very optimistic about the future!”

‘If I Could’ follows the recent singles ‘Gimme That Boom’ and ‘Set Fazers’; dancefloor bangers which blast out Skindred’s trademark ragga-metal to maximum effect.

Across the brand new album Smile, Skindred channel a huge range of styles – from reggae to metal, rock to pop, dub to electro – creating the most mind-expanding and potent collection of songs they have delivered yet, designed to melt stereos around the world. Fans can pre-order it here.

And as one of the most entertaining bands on the planet it’s no wonder that they have recently been nominated for Best UK Live Act at the Heavy Music Awards on May 26th and will be supporting rock legends KISS on their farewell UK dates this summer.
