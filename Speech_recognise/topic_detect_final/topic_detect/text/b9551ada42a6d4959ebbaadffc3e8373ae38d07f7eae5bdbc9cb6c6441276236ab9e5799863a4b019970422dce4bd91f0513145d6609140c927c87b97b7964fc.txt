Indescribable Activity Book for Kids by Louie Giglio with Tama Fortner is a cool interactive activity book for children ages six to ten.

This book has 165 pages of activities in it. There are mazes, puzzles, logic games, STEM projects, Simple Science Projects as well as ideas for helping people in the community. It is full of fun and learning activies that are both big and small, some are active and some are more laid-back. All of them would be great to use at home with children during summer vacation and they could be used along with homeschool lessons. This book also includes God alongside the science so children focus on faith as well as learning.

The illustrations done by Nicola Anderson and Lynsey Wilson are bright and colorful. They would definitely draw a child in. I also like that there is an index in the back if you or the child are wanting to focus on something specific.

I received a copy of this book from the publisher. All opinions within this review are my own.
