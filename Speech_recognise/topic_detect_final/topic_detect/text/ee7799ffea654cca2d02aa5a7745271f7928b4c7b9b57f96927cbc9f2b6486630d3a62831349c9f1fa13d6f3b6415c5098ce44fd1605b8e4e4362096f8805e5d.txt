Marvel Snap dropped a new update today taking a pass at the token shop, game board, seasonal series drops, and more. Included in the update is an adjustment that ensures that players of Infinite Rank will only be matched against other Infinite Rank players. In addition, the update now provides players with more information on their cards. Tapping a card in the shop or in a collection will provide players with information on the artist, card series, variant rarity, and more. Inspecting the card will also allow players to ‘flip’ them so they can see the backs and all their details.

The patch also includes balance updates. The devs are pretty happy with what they’ve done so far but feel that the Shuri-Taskmaster decks and Lockjaw-Leech shells are still a bit too loved. Today’s adjustments will hopefully make room for other deck types in the card game in the future.
