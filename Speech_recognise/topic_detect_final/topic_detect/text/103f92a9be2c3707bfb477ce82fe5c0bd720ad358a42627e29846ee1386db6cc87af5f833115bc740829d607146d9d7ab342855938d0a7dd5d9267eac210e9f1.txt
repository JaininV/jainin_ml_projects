The landscape of pet custody is evolving in British Columbia, with significant changes to the Family Law Act affecting the way family pets are treated during divorce or separation.

More and more pets are treated as humans and are given the respect they deserve when it comes to what is in their best interests. Previously, they were treated as mere property and not everyone agreed with such an approach.

In this comprehensive guide, we explore the implications of the changes to BC law for pet owners and provide insights on how to navigate the complexities of pet custody in this changing legal environment.

Prior to the recent amendments, family pets were treated as personal property under the Family Law Act, lumped together with other assets like cars, houses, and furniture. This classification often led to sad outcomes for pet owners who considered their pets as family members rather than mere possessions. The new amendments aim to address this issue by giving family pets a unique classification and providing courts with more specific guidance on handling pet custody cases.

The proposed amendments to the Family Law Act in British Columbia try to treat pets like humans. The best interests of the pet are the focal point and the court must consider issues such as family violence, previous care, and the relationship between children and pets to determine who the pets go to at separation or divorce.

The legislation will  include a new definition for pets, referred to as “companion animals.” This tries to provide better guidance for the courts when they handle pet custody disputes and help pet owners better understand their rights and responsibilities.

The changes to the Family Law Act outline several factors for courts to consider when determining the ownership of a companion animal. These factors include:

The circumstances in which the companion animal was acquired

The extent to which each spouse cared for the companion animal

A spouse’s cruelty, or threat of cruelty, toward an animal

The relationship that a child has with the companion animal

The willingness and ability of each spouse to care for the basic needs of the companion animal

Any other circumstances the court considers relevant

These factors will be considered by the courts in making decisions about pet custody, allowing for a more nuanced and pet-centric approach to resolving disputes.

Developing a comprehensive pet custody agreement that outlines responsibilities, parenting time, and financial obligations can help protect the interests of your beloved pet.

In many cases, mediation or collaborative law processes can be helpful in reaching an amicable agreement. These methods involve working with trained professionals to help facilitate discussions and negotiations, ultimately leading to a resolution that suits the needs of all parties involved, including the family pet.

Often though, pet custody can be a black-and-white issue where the pet can only stay with one of the spouses. In these cases, you will require experienced legal counsel to help you navigate the court system and obtain custody of your pets. Contact us.

For couples in common law relationships, the proposed changes to the Family Law Act provide additional clarity and support in navigating pet custody disputes. Now the provincial court in addition to the Supreme Court can handle pet custody matters.

With the Provincial Court gaining jurisdiction over companion animal matters, couples in common law relationships now have an alternative legal venue to resolve their pet custody issues. This is beneficial for those who may not have other assets or property to divide, as the BC Supreme Court can be a more expensive option for resolving disputes.
