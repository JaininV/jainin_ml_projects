In prayer, go back to yourself as a child, go through your entire life and see how the world has shaped you, for the better and for the worse, the things in your control and the events out of your control. Forgive yourself, be thankful, and be grateful for your struggles. Do the same for the most wicked people you have encountered throughout your life, view them as children, see how few of their ideas are their own, see how the world shaped them, then forgive them. This really helped me, I spent too much time on techniques and self help. God bless.
