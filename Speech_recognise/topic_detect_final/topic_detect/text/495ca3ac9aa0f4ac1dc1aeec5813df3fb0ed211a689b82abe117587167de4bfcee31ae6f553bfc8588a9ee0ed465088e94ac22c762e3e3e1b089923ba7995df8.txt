LOVE Island's Ekin-Su  Cülcüloglu and her boyfriend Davide Sanclimenti have sparked split rumours after an alleged infidelity.

The Sun revealed show winner Ekin-Su, 28, confronted a rival model over a suspected fling with her lover — branding her a “f***ing slag”.

She accused Harriet Wilson, 24, of “sleeping with my boyfriend” and warned her: “You’re finished.”

Ekin-Su also took aim at Instagram model Phoebe Wintle after finding texts from the women on Davide’s phone.

After weeks without being pictured together, fans fear Ekin-Su and Davide will never be seen together again.

"Did they break up?", asked one fan.

Another asked: "Will there ever be another Ekinde grid post?"

Ekin-Su has kept fans guessing about her relationship.

She's posted a series of cryptic posts online, including one saying: "Life is matter of choices, and every choice you make makes you."

Meanwhile Davide has been sharing a number of pictures on Instagram - but they're all of himself.

One fan begged: "Please tell me the rumours aren't true."

Another said: "I hope you didn't break up. You and Ekin are my favourite couple."

Ekin-Su had a bust-up with Italian hunk Davide, 28, fearing that he’d had a tryst with Harriet and Phoebe in Manchester.

The row kicked off after she returned from Belfast, where she signed cosmetic products for fans.

In messages to Harriet seen by The Sun on Sunday, Ekin-Su blasted: “You f***ing slag. Sleeping with my boyfriend! Disgusting. Why would you do that?

“You and Phoebe are gonna be shown to everyone slags. Pretending nothing happened. Just wait for it.

Ekin-Su and Davide, who moved in together shortly after winning Love Island last summer, flew out for a make-or-break trip to Amsterdam recently.

Fans noted she posted no images of him.

Davide, however, uploaded a snap of Ekin-Su at breakfast in £500-a-night Hotel Estherea to reassure fans they were still together.
