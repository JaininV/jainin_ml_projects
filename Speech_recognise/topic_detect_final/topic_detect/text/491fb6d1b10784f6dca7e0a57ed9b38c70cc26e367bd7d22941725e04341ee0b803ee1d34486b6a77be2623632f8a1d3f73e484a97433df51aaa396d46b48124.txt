“It just boils down to this,” Mr. Durbin said. “Tomorrow this could happen to the Republicans, and they could find themselves in a vulnerable position through no fault of their own. I hope that they’ll show a little kindness and caring for their colleague.”

Faced with a situation in which there were no good options, some Democrats viewed the stalemate as a way to coax Ms. Feinstein to consider her next steps.

“If this goes on month after month after month, then she’s going to have to make a decision with her family and her friends about what her future holds,” Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, said on ABC’s “This Week” on Sunday. Ms. Klobuchar also said that she was taking Ms. Feinstein at her word that she would be back soon. “This isn’t just about California. It’s also about the nation.”

Adding to the growing pressure on Ms. Feinstein is that in a moment of divided government, with Republicans in control of the House, judicial nominations are among the only things Senate Democrats can do on their own.

“The situation of just letting the nominations stall endlessly is not tenable,” said Brian Fallon, the executive director of the progressive advocacy group Demand Justice. “The conversation needs to be shifted to what can be done now. That concern hasn’t gone away, and this option isn’t going to solve it.”
