Katrina Mullen, a nurse working at Community Hospital North in Indianapolis, was assigned to Shariya Small, a teenager with two sickly baby girls and a boy, The Washington Post reported. Mullen herself was a single mother of five children and had become a teen mom at the age of 16.

Mullen visited Small, who was living about an hour away in a relative's house, and was dismayed to see that the babies shared one playpen and bassinet between them, and Small slept on a couch.

"I didn't even think it through," Mullen said. "Everybody in my life thought I was insane, and I probably was at that point, but I could not let her be separated from them," she told The Post.
