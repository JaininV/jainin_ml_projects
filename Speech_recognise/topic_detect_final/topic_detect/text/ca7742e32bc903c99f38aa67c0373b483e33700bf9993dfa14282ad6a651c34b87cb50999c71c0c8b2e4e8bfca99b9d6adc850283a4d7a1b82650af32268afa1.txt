A technique developed by researchers at the U. K.'s Lancaster University can print conductive circuits inside living organisms using a photonic three-dimensional (3D) printer.

With a photonic 3D printer and an ink containing the fluorescent plastic polypyrrole, the researchers printed star and square shapes inside living nematode worms.

Lancaster's John Hardy said, "In principle, with a human or other larger organism, you could print around 10 centimeters (nearly 4 inches) in."

Hardy said conductive circuits printed inside the body could have a wide range of applications, from biomedical settings to agriculture.
