Radio Jerusalem’s broadcaster Elad Amadi, who was suspended twice this year for inflammatory expressions and who is suspected of incitement and issuing threats against Supreme Court President Esther Hayut, will host the Independence Day celebrations in Jerusalem next week.

The municipality said that it was standing by its choice of Amadi, “who has been hosting events and ceremonies in the city for years.”

Amadi hosts a program that is known for its extremist statements made on air. Last February, he called on Justice Minister Yariv Levin to hit Hayut with a club, also asking a member of the station’s editorial board if she would like to take a pistol and do what the “extremist left wants to do.” An investigation was opened in this case, based on his suspected incitement to violence.

Amadi was suspended for a month and a half in this case, after he had already been suspended for two days a month earlier, after making another violent statement against fans of the Hapoel Jerusalem soccer club.

Amadi had threatened to use violence against the team’s fans, saying: “It will be worth my while to sit in prison because of people like you.” He later said that “these scumbags are the same people who rush to beat soldiers, perpetrating all this terror. Most of them are from Breaking the Silence, B’Tselem, all the various Israel-haters who have taken over the soccer stadium.”

Jerusalem’s Deputy Mayor Yossi Havilio harshly criticized the selection of Amadi, “who has called for serious violent acts against the Supreme Court’s president, against fans of Hapoel Jerusalem, and against demonstrators for democracy.” He called this move “a shameful and disgraceful act which must be stopped.”

He said it was a reward for thuggish behavior. The municipality said in response that Havilio is the only council member to oppose Amadi’s selection, and that his opposition was a result of the impending municipal election.
