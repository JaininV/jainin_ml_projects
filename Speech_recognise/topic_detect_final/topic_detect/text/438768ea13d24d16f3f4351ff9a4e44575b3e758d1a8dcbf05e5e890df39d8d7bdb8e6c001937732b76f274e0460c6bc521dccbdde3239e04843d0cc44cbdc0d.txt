ChatGPT has sent shock waves through the halls of higher education. Universities have rushed to release guidelines on how it can be used in the classroom. Professors have taken to social media to share a spectrum of AI policies. And students have cautiously experimented with the idea of allowing it to play a part in their academic work.

But the notion of a measured response to the emergence of this powerful chatbot seems to have barely penetrated the world of Kâ€“12 education. Instead of transparent, well-defined expectations, high schoolers across the country have been confronted with a silent coup of blocked AI websites. That is a shame.
