The Moonlight Players Theatre is bringing to life all of your

favorite Dr. Seuss characters in the fantastical, magical, musical extravaganza, “Seussical the Musical!” Oh, the thinks you can think… when you think about SEUSS,” Director Lavonte Rogers notes.

“From books to the stage, Seussical is a musical extravaganza featuring all Dr. Seuss’s great works! Our production features a talented cast of 24 with most of the actors being new to our

SEUSSiCAL THE company. We hope you can join us as these characters collide to create a ‘MUsiCAL beautiful story!”

This production marks the third time The Moonlight Players Theatre will perform at the Clermont Performing Arts Center. “The goal of the Clermont Performing Arts Center has always been to elevate the already thriving local arts community in Lake County and we are doing just that with this production of Seussical the Musical,” Clermont Performing Arts Center Manager Jon Sousan said. “After the success of Godspell in 2021 and the 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee in 2022, we knew we wanted another collaboration.

This show perfectly showcases the talent that lives right here in our backyard.” Performances will take place at 7:30 p.m. on April 21, 22, 28 and 29 and at 3 p.m. on April 23 and 30 in the Black Box Theater. Tickets for all six performances are on sale now and can be purchased at www. ClermontPAC.com or by calling 352-394-4800.
