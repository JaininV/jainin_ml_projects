Mozambique hosts more than 31,000 refugees and asylum-seekers, while more than one million people remain displaced internally due to violence perpetrated by non-state armed groups and the devastating impact of the climate crisis â€“ where Mozambique is one of the most adversely affected countries in the world. The double landfall of Tropical Cyclone Freddy in February and March 2023 has devastated the country, destroying infrastructure and displacing some 184,000 people. Subsequent flooding has furthermore increased the risk of cholera.

This context, paired with lingering effects of COVID-19, has resulted in further disenfranchisement of already vulnerable populations.

UNHCR and partners work closely with a range of stakeholders, including the Government, to provide lifesaving protection services and assistance to refugees, asylum-seekers, IDPs, IDP returnees as well as host communities, while harnessing opportunities to invest in and build resilience among communities and facilitate sustainable solutions to displacement.

UNHCR stresses that all refugee and IDP return movements should take place in an informed, safe, voluntary and dignified manner. At the same time, UNHCR supports the inclusion of all refugees and IDPs in national services and systems, including national data systems and climate related contingency planning and response. At the same time, UNHCR is scaling-up engagement with development and peace-building actors to ultimately support the inclusion of displaced populations through the expansion of their respective programming.
