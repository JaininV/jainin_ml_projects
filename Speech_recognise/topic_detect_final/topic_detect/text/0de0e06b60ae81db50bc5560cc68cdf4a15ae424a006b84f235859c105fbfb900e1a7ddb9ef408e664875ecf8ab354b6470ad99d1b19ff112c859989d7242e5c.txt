Last December, I started writing full-time, and I’m building my freelance business whilst travelling the world.

Since then, I’ve spent two months in Budapest, and I’m currently in Chiang Mai. I work around 20 hours a week. The rest of my time is spent exploring, relaxing, and speaking with friends.
