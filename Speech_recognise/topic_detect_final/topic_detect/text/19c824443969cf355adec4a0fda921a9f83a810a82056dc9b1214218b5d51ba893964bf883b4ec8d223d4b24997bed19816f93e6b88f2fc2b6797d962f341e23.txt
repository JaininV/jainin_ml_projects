Kyle Sandilands' fiancée Tegan Kynaston treated herself to a pampering day at a hair salon in Sydney on Wednesday, ahead of the couple's big-budget wedding.

The 37-year-old communications director was seen arriving at the swanky Double Bay establishment La Boutique with straight blonde locks.

She left the salon three hours later sporting a fresh 'do featuring golden curls that perfectly framed her face.

The Nueva Sangria co-founder rocked a cropped graphic jumper over skintight black leggings for a casual look.

Arriving for her appointment with a friend, she concealed her gaze behind a pair of sunglasses, and accessorised with trendy white sneakers.

She carried a takeaway coffee as she left the salon and flashed her glitzy engagement ring, rumoured to have cost $1.14million.

With a designer handbag hanging off her shoulder, she lifted a hand to shield herself from the sun, exposing a glimpse of her toned torso.

Tegan and Kyle, 51, are scheduled to tie the knot on April 29. The radio king recently admitted he had already spent a fortune on the extravagant nuptials.

'I've spent $150,000 for flowers and $100,000 on catering. I didn't realise how much making serviettes with your own emblem costs,' he said on The Kyle and Jackie O Show last month.

'We are already up to $250,000 and we only have flowers and food.'

Kyle added that while he had managed to book musicians to perform at his wedding for free, he still had to pay for their travel expenses.

His co-host Jackie 'O' Henderson, 48, was stunned by the hefty price tag and admitted her entire wedding only cost $80,000.
