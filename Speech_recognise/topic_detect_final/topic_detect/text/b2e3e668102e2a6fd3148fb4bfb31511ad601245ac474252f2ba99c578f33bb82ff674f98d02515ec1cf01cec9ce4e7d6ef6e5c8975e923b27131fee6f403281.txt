Spend the evening with Rob Beckett and Romesh Ranganathan at the Southbank. For one night only, they’re joining the prestigious Royal Philarmonic Orchestra.

They’ve joined forces with the world renowned orchestra for their Sky telly series, Rob and Romesh Vs.

Details are thin on the ground as to exactly what they’ll be doing, but we do know they’ll be some brilliant music and a lot of belly laughs. So, make haste to the link below and snap up your FREEBIE tickets now – they’re going quickly.

Obviously, they’ll be filming so you might want to get the iron out!
