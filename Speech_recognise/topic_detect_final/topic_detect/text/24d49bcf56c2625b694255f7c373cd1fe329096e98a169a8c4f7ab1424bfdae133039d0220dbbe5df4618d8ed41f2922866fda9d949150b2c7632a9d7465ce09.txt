Joliet Public Schools District 86 received the Joliet Region Chamber of Commerce &  Industry Educational Institute of the Year Award. The award was presented to Joliet District 86 representatives during the Joliet Chamber of Commerce Annual Dinner & Celebration of Success event held at the 176 West banquet facility.

“I am proud to be a part of a school district that is working towards excellence,” said Joliet Public Schools District 86 Board of School Inspectors President Erick Deshaun Dorris. “This recognition is a result of all the work being done by our teachers, principals, employees, and community members.” This year, three school districts and an educational foundation were nominated for this recognition. Once the Joliet Chamber notified the organizations of their nominations, officials submitted a comprehensive

application to be considered for the award.

Joliet Public Schools District 86, currently the third largest elementary school district in Illinois, serves nearly 9,800 students (preschool through eighth grade) at 21 schools in the city of Joliet.
