Mike Gundy’s staff has landed its second 2024 commitment of the weekend, and its second from the same school.

Caleb Hackleman, an offensive lineman from Pleasant Grove (Texas) announced his pledge via Twitter on Sunday as he capped his official weekend visit to OSU. The Cowboys offered Hackleman in early March and he also was in Stillwater for a visit at the start of spring practice.

Hackleman hails from Pleasant Grove in Texarkana, Texas. The 6-foot-6, 275-mauler also holds offers from Baylor, Texas Tech, Memphis and Austin Peay. On3 Recruiting rates Hackleman as a three-star prospect, the No. 31 interior OL in the class and the No. 84 prospect out of Texas. But his size, and a look at his highlight film below, reveals a tough tackle that frequently puts defenders on their backs, if not bull-dozing them over completely.

Hackleman is teammates with linebacker Jaylen Boardley, who was also in town this weekend and committed to OSU late Friday night. This moves OSU’s 2024 class to five commitments and to No. 38 nationally and fourth in the Big 12 according to 247Sports.
