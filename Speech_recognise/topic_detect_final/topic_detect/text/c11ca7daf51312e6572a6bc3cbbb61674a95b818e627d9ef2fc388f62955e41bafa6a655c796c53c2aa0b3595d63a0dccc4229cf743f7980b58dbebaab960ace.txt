These customers got in touch with us as they had decided they wanted a brand new quality kitchen. Their previous kitchen had lasted over 25 years! They wanted to choose a more unusual colour for this new living space but still have plenty of family room as well as lots of cupboard space with a nice lot of worktops. However, still leaving room for a kitchen table. This was a big decision for them and it always takes a little time to decide on a large lifestyle change such as a new kitchen; re colour choices etc. but with our help and advice they made their final decisions.

Russ went to their family home and measured up. The choice they made has given them a really high quality Schüller kitchen. It is fun, unusual and really striking. Along with high quality appliances, this will look amazing for many years to come!

We would just like to thank all at Russ Deacon Home Improvements for our fabulous kitchen. From the original consultation to when our fabulous designs were provided, which included looking at a different approach that resulted in our stylish, practical and comfortable kitchen. Their patience when we couldn’t decide on a final splash back was very encouraging and led to us being 100% delighted. I think it’s the attention to detail and making sure every aspect is covered that makes them outstanding. Thank you.
