JOE Cattini, one the UK's last D-Day veterans who was in one the first waves of assault on the Normandy beaches, has died aged 100.

Sarah Burr, Joe's granddaughter, announced in a statement that her "beloved grandad" passed away yesterday evening.

She wrote: "A life so well lived. One of the last D-Day veterans left. We are so proud of him and loved him so much.

"The past nine years since D-Day 70 were some of the happiest of his life.

"From (like most of his generation) never having really talked about his war experiences to sharing them with so many others in recent years was so important to him."

There are only around half a dozen living British veterans who fought on the beaches on June 6, 1944 in an immense assault that led to the liberation of France from Nazi occupation, according to the Spirit of Normandy Trust.

The charity estimates that there are only around 25 veterans of the entire Normandy campaign, which helped turn the tide of the Second World War, left.
