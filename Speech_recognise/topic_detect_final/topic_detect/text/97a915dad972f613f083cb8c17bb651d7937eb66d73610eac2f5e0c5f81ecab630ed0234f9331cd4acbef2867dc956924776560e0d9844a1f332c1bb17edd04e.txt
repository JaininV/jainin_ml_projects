RINOs are not standing up to Joe Biden’s radical agenda.

RINO Lindsey Graham is being pressured to slow down the pace that Biden’s judges are being appointed.

Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S. C.), the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, is coming under pressure from conservatives on his panel and outside Congress to slow down consideration of President Biden’s judicial nominees.

Graham has voted for more of Biden’s nominees than any other Republican on the Judiciary Committee, something that is coming under scrutiny from conservatives after Democrats this week celebrated the 100th successful confirmation of a Biden judicial nominee.

Senate Democrats are well ahead of the pace set by Republicans when they controlled the Senate during former President Trump’s term in office. Senate Republicans didn’t confirm the 100th judge appointed by Trump until May of 2019 — about three months later than when Biden hit the milestone.

Hawley pointed out how Republican leadership dropped the ball on slowing the process.

Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo, a Judiciary Committee member, told The Hill that Republican “leadership squandered a 50-50 Senate” before the midterm elections last year.

“They could have, at the committee level, made a major push to vote together and to stop at least the circuit court nominees,” Hawley said. “Every single one of them would have required a discharge petition. We didn’t do that.

“There was no concerted effort made whatsoever. Say what you want about [Democratic Judiciary Committee Chairman] Dick Durbin [D-Ill.], but he has not taken his eye off the ball. He’s had help from Republicans.”
