We were treated to some excellent football in the Champions League quarter-finals first legs last week and there is still a lot to play for in the second legs.

Here is all you need to know about this week’s fixtures.

AC Milan have a one-goal advantage over Napoli heading into the second leg. Ismael Bennacer was the scorer while Napoli later had Andre-Frank Zambo Anguissa sent off, ruling him out of the home leg. Napoli’s star striker Victor Osimhen was not involved in the match and question marks remain whether he will be involved on Tuesday as his goals have been crucial to his side this season.

Chelsea have got a lot of work to do in the second leg after going two goals down in Madrid thanks to Karim Benzema and Marco Asensio. Things got worse for Frank Lampard’s side when Ben Chilwell was shown a straight red card for a challenge on Rodrygo. Los Blancos showed once again why they are the club with the most titles in this grand competition and while it seems that the La Liga title is out of their grasp, the fans would be elated with a 15th Champions League title.
