The global Capnography Devices Market size is expected to reach USD 1.31 billion by 2030, registering a CAGR of 9.9% over the forecast period, according to a new report by Grand View Research, Inc. The introduction of regulatory guidelines for procedural sedation and the growing adoption of capnography inpatient monitoring due to higher reliability & efficiency are anticipated to propel the market growth over the forecast period. In addition, associated advantages, such as ease of usage, minimally invasive nature, and medical efficiency, are also driving the product demand, thereby supporting market growth. Moreover, rising cases of respiratory diseases needing continuous patient monitoring are expected to fuel the product demand in the coming years.

The pandemic has enhanced product sales as the demand for remote respiratory monitoring equipment soars. The COVID-19 pandemic had a positive impact on the overall market as companies, such as Medtronic, witnessed increased product demand during the pandemic. Some companies, such as Capsule Technologies, also received product approvals for their capnography monitors during the pandemic, which further resulted in positive market growth. Moreover, the increasing geriatric population and changing lifestyles further positively impact the market growth. Features, such as cost-effective and non-invasive devices, make it an ideal procedure for respiratory monitoring. The market is highly competitive and a limited number of players have a high level of dominance over the total revenue share.

The most notable market participants are Medtronic, Smiths Medical, Masimo Corp., etc., and account for a considerable share owing to their product offerings to the market. Advancements in technology have paved the way for the innovation of portable, efficient, and automatic devices. For instance, in April 2021, Masimo proclaimed that it has received FDA 510(k) clearance for its Radius PCG, a portable capnograph. The device comes with wireless Bluetooth connectivity. Key companies are involved in the establishment of extensive distribution systems as well as in mergers &acquisitions to capture a larger share of the market. For instance, in January 2021, Koninklijke Philips N. V. announced the acquisition of Capsule Technologies, Inc., hence enhancing its position in the patient care management solutions for the hospitals’ industry.
