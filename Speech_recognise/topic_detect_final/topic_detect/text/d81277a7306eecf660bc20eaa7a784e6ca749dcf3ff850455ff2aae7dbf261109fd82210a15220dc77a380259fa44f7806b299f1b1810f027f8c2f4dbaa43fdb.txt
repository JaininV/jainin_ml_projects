Muslims should adhere to the times for Mecca, since the days are much shorter there in the summer.  Their prayer rules allow enough sleep in Mecca, but only 4 1/2 hours of sleep in Minneapolis, due to the longer days in the summer.  That’s apart from the fact that it’s unfair, anyway.  Will they now finally replace their city council and mayor? Minneapolis already did away with single family zoning.  Their goal seems to be to make the city into a tenement house slum.

People need to sue before this spreads.  When in Rome, do as the Romans.  They need to return to Somalia, if they want the call to prayer.  Sleep deprived people can do crazy things, so this needs to be addressed in the courts quickly.  Waking people at 11 pm and again at 3:30 am for 6 minutes constitutes torture.

Although Muslims, in Minneapolis, remain a small minority, they still have 20 mosques.  And, the way that the new noise ordinance is written they can use amplifying equipment in their homes and apartments and/or pray loudly.

Right now only one or two doing it.  More may start.  The one in the video clip has a speaker angled on a roof to blast out to a large apartment complex.  They intend to buy a new system to blast louder and wake more people up to pray – “Muslim Call to Prayer Approved in Minneapolis” https://youtu.be/tnk1UXADIp8   They should buy those special clocks or a regular alarm to wake themselves instead of tormenting other people.

The way the law is written, people can apparently put their Muslim prayer alarm clocks mega-loud too. However, the existence of these clocks for means that there is no reason for the rooftop calls with loudspeakers: “Athan (Adhan) Clock Plays 5 Daily Muslim Calls to Prayer” https://youtu.be/0LIIv8UYqM0 There are other models, too.

“Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey on Monday signed into law a change in the city’s noise ordinance so that the Muslim call to prayer, or adhan, can be broadcast from speakers atop the city’s 20 mosques at any time of the day…

Around the summer solstice, the first call could sound as early at 3:30 a.m. and the final call around 11 p.m. In the depths of winter, the times for the first and last prayer of the day are closer to 6 a.m. and 6 p.m…

The amended noise ordinance allows sounds associated with religious worship, such as the adhan, to be amplified for up to 6 minutes.” https://web.archive.org/web/20230418040135/https://www.startribune.com/mayor-jacob-frey-signs-change-allowing-muslim-call-to-prayer-at-any-time-in-minneapolis/600267819/

“Previously, rules put limits on the volume (no higher than 70 decibels) and time the calls could be played. Going forward, mosques will be able to broadcast the call as early as 3:30 a.m., and as late as 11 p.m.” https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/minneapolis-mayor-signs-change-to-noise-ordinance-allowing-amplified-call-to-prayer-5-times-a-day/ar-AA19YAMj

The multiple mosques aren’t coordinated.  This is one minute but they are going to call 6 minutes in Minneapolis.
