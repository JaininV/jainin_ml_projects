The #1 channel in the U. S. Top 50 continues to dominate the global edition of our weekly rankings, and its status as the all-American chart leader is not in doubt.

Behind that channel, a trend is emerging. All of the other channels in the U. S. top five belong to individual creators, not media companies.

Cocomelon – Nursery Rhymes can’t be caught (at least not yet). The California-based subsidiary of London-based company Moonbug (which its itself underneath U. S.-based firm Candle Media) collected 763 million weekly views through its primary YouTube hub. Cocomelon increased its viewership by 28% week-over-week to consolidate its hold on the #1 spot. Amazingly, Cocomelon’s astonishing numbers aren’t anywhere near its peak, since it once got one billion views in a single week.

For the second week in a row, Alan Chikin Chow claimed runner-up status in the U. S. Top 50. Chow was one of a few short-form creators who was able to match Cocomelon’s week-over-week gains. The Californian comedian rode a 29% week-over-week bump to finish with 522 million weekly views. Chow has perfected the art of short-form comedy, and good things keep coming to him as a result.

YoesIan made a triumphant return to the U. S. top five. After landing at #8 a week ago, the channel known for its grim reaper character snagged 308.6 million weekly views and moved up to third place as a result. YoesIan’s lifetime viewership is even scarier, as the YouTube Shorts hub as now collected 15 billion YouTube views in all.

Dylan Anderson joined the parade of individual creators in the U. S. top five. Anderson works hard enough to release daily uploads, which often touch on inspirational and heartwarming subjects. Fans have shown their appreciation by delivering 298.7 million weekly views to Anderson’s YouTube channel. Chalk one up to the power of positivity.

MrBeast rounds out this week’s U. S. top five. The man born Jimmy Donaldson has two entries in the U.S. Top 50, and the bigger of those hubs added 298.4 million views during the week that was.

In recent weeks, animation channels have been trending up on YouTube Shorts. Digital destinations like BigSchool have soared toward the top of the charts by making colorful videos that star beloved family characters. Goodland Short is another animation channel harnessing the power of YouTube’s TikTok competitor, but its videos aren’t always so family-friendly.

If you’ve seen the movie Sausage Party, you’ll know what to expect when you look at the list of Goodland Short’s most-watched videos. Viewers are taking an interest in animations that imagine food prep as the macabre torture of helpless fruits and vegetables. Those clips are a fair bit sicker and grislier than the typical YouTube Shorts cartoon.

For sensitive viewers, Goodland Shorts balances its horrifying videos with others that are a lot easier to handle. An all-sausage recreation of the Lady and the Tramp kiss scene has scooped up more than 74 million views. Goodland’s chip-crushing fist has performed even better, with 84 million views.

On the whole, Goodland Short amassed 105.4 million weekly views to break into the U. S. Top 50 in 49th place. The channel registered a week-over-week viewership increase of 23%, and if it can keep repeating that trend, it will reach two billion lifetime YouTube views before the end of April.

I’m rooting for animation to have a place on YouTube Shorts, so Goodland’s success is encouraging. If it can reach two billion without uploading any more culinary torture porn, that would be even better.

This week, there are 37 YouTube Shorts channels in the U. S. Top 50.
