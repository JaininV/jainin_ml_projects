Motorists and the drivers of long high sided vehicles are being asked to drive with extreme caution coming up to the Nenagh Road Roundabout.

During the course of last night or early this morning, someone or rather something collided with a motorway, directional, road signs on the R498 roundabout, leading onto the Jimmy Doyle Road or back into Thurles Town.

one section of the sign, for the past 10 hours at least has remained swinging over the inner lane of the roundabout, and persons failing to operate proper diligence could lose their wind-scream and/or severely damage vehicle bodywork.

Meanwhile, vehicles travelling south on the N62 Section of Brittas Road, Thurles, and the junction of Brittas Road and Cuchulain Road, (travelling both westward and sothward); please note expect to encounter giant road craters.

Someone joked with me the other day that to get a pothole filled in Thurles town, local councillors are insisting that local residents apply for planning permission to Tipperary Co. Council; hence the long delays.
