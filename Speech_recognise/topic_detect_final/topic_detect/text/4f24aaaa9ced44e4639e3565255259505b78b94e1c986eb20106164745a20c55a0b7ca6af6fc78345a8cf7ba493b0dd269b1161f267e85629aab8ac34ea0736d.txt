It’s been the question on everyone’s lips ever since it was revealed scenes from The Crown were to be filmed at York Minster this week.

Which iconic royal event is being recreated inside the ancient cathedral?

Now it appears we have the answer.

The first clue came when hundreds of extras arrived at the Minster, all dressed in their finest wedding outfits.

Women in a variety of posh frocks and hats were bussed in separately from the men, dressed in three piece morning suits and tails.

So we knew it was a royal wedding.

And it turns out, they are filming the marriage of Prince Charles to Camilla.

York Minster is standing in for the real wedding venue – St George’s Chapel in Windsor. The now King and Queen married there in 2005.

Dominic West, playing Charles, and Olivia Williams as Camilla, will recreate the moment that the long-time lovers tied the knot.

The stars have been carefully shepherded away from the crowds waiting outside the Minster this week.

According to the Mail Online, Netflix intends the wedding to be the grand finale of The Crown. Season six is the last to be filmed, and by ending on the royal wedding it is hoped viewers will be left with a ‘warm and happy’ feeling.

It follows criticism of the fictionalised royal drama for remaking the Paris car crash which killed Diana, Princess of Wales, for earlier episodes in this final season.

A Netflix source apparently told the Mail: “Charles and Camilla’s wedding will be a true celebration and a really happy moment in the history of the monarchy. It also fits nicely into the King’s Coronation year.”

The filming comes less than two weeks after the real King and Queen Camilla were in York Minster for the Maundy service.

According to one official at the Minster, 450 extras are taking part in the filming this week. They were being catered for in a marquee in Dean’s Park at lunchtime.
