Logan Paul has signed a new contract with WWE after his deal with the professional wrestling company expired following WrestleMania.

The YouTuber took to Twitter on Monday to share a photo of himself holding his new WWE contract alongside Paul 'Triple H' Levesque.

The photo, which has been liked by 35,000 people, featured a yellow bottle of Prime - which comes as no surprise considering Paul is always trying to promote his brand.

Speaking about his new deal with WWE, Paul said he felt 'incredibly blessed to have found something that I am good at'.

The 28-year-old also said he was committed to 'building' the WWE legacy after making his debut in April 2021.

Speaking about his deal, Paul said: 'I feel incredibly blessed to have found something that I'm good at, at 28 years old.

'And the fact that the organisation believes I'm good enough to continue hopefully building this WWE legacy is mind-blowing.

'I'm incredibly grateful and incredibly blessed. And as long as I can keep putting on good shows, man, I'm gonna keep doing this sport.'

Meanwhile, Triple H said: 'Logan has just been a game-changer. I mean, he's probably the most natural guy I have ever seen.

'It's almost like he was made for this business. Just being natural as far as talking and being on camera. He's so good at that. And then his athleticism is just next level.

'He's exactly the kind of guy that I look for as a WWE superstar. Whether he was an influencer or not, he'd be the kind of guy I'd look for as a superstar.'
