Jamie Chung has joined the cast of the upcoming drama film I’m Beginning to See The Light, Deadline reports.

The film follows Ezra (Jack Huston), a jazz trumpeter who is grieving the tragic loss of his wife and daughter. He soon meets Hannah (Abbie Cornish) a local school teacher who brings color back into his life.

Chung will play Ezra’s wife Sarah. Before she died, Sarah was angry with Ezra for focusing on his career more than her and their 10-year-old daughter. Brandon T. Jackson has been cast as Sam, a bass guitarists who befriends Ezra.

The film is the creation of filmmaker Konstantin Khudyakov who based the story on a screenplay by Mark Bacci. Bacci will also serve as an executive producer, Deadline reports.

Production is slated to begin this spring. Chung will reunite with her Sucker Punch co-star Abbie Cornish. It seems unlikely that the two will share scenes together, however, based on the plot.

Recently, Chung has acted in films like The Misfits, Batman: Soul of The Dragon and Dangerous Lies. She also appeared in the third episode of the final season of Succession. Her brief appearance on the critically acclaimed television show left fans feeling excited but also confused.
