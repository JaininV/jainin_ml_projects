Are you sitting down? Pour a glass of water and crack a window because this news might send you into cardiac arrest if you’re not careful. Zac Efron has followed Vanessa Hudgens on Instagram. No, you’re right, let’s go to the emergency room just to be safe.

The High School Musical costars were together on- and off-screen during the mid-to-late aughts and were one of the biggest teen couples of their era. Think Zendaya and Tom Holland, but with singing! They broke up in 2010, and Hudgens (who was suspiciously missing from Coachella this year) recently announced her engagement to professional baseball player Cole Tucker.

So, when did Efron follow her, exactly? Well, fans seemingly discovered the social media update on April 17, but it might have happened sometime before then. On Twitter there was a full-on meltdown over the news, which sparked many a nostalgic feeling.
