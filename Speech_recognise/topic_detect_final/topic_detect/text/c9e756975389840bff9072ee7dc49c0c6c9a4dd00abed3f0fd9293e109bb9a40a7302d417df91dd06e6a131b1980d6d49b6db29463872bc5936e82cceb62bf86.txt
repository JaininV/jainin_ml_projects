you see this?

This is my wife, Kim Pine

I love her and i want to marry her and she's super cool and her red hair is cute and she's cute and nice and i really really like her and how smart and talented she is!!>>136749126

But she doesn't like you and never will. Kim would have gotten back with Scott at Volume 5. Had Scott fought to save Kim, instead of being motivated to save her because of a fake text from Ramona.
