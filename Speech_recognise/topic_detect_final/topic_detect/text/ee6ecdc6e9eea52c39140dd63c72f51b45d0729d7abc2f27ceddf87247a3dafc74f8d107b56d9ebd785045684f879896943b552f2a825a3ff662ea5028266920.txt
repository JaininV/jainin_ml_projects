Christ is with us — and that makes all the difference, as Benedict reminded us.

If your favorite Bible verse is Jeremiah 29:11, what is your favorite quote from Benedict XVI?

“The one who has hope lives differently.” Spe Salvi (Saved in Hope)

Christian hope implores us to see life through the lens of eternity — no matter what is happening here below. From daily annoyances to heavy-duty suffering, Christ will see us through.

In this Easter season, we renew this hope.

Our Risen Lord is with us, amid the delights and drudgeries of this world; amid the joy and sorrow, stresses and surprises; amid work and discernment and doubt; amid family life; and amid moments of fellowship and friendship, heartfelt conversation and connection.

Christ is with us — and that makes all the difference, as Benedict reminded us.

That one memorable line from Saved in Hope reflects this truth:

“Hope is the theological virtue by which we desire the kingdom of heaven and eternal life as our happiness, placing our trust in Christ’s promises and relying not on our own strength, but on the help of the grace of the Holy Spirit.”
