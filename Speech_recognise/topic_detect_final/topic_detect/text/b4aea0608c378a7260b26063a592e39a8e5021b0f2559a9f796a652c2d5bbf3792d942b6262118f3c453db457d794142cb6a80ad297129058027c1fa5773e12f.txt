Shreveport's Bourbon and Barbecue Festival is back for its third year and thankfully, this time they're holding it when it'll be cooler out! I went last year when they held it in June and it was just too hot to enjoy yourself. This year's event is planned for April which is PERFECT!

The 3rd Annual Bourbon and Barbecue Festival is scheduled for Saturday, April 22, 2023, in the Red River District in downtown Shreveport from 3 - 8 pm. You had us at hello! Bourbon AND BBQ? We'll see you there! I'll admit, when I first saw this even pop up a few years ago, I immediately assumed this was something that was happening in Texas. After all, while we're known for great cajun, creole, and seafood here in Louisiana, Texas seems to own the 'great bbq' image.

Well, we're apparently making strides when it comes to our barbeque here in Louisiana, hence, the return of the Bourbon and Barbeque Festival. All too often in our area, people are afraid to start something new because of the uncertainty of whether or not locals will support it. I'm so glad the organizers behind this festival took a leap of faith, even if the pandemic slowed it down in the beginning. Trust me, I'll be there to sample your goodies!

General admission tickets are $55 and for that price, you'll get seven barbecue samples, six bourbon samples, and four cocktails. VIP tickets are $155 and you'll get everything the general admission ticket goer gets plus an upgrade to a private VIP lounge sponsored by Knob Creek, a hand-rolled cigar, select bourbons provided by Beam Suntory, and select Barrel Pick offerings. It goes without saying that this is a 21+ event. They'll be announcing more information soon, including the competitors for each category, entertainment, etc... We'll keep you posted as we get more info!
