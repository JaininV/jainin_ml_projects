La Presse reports on two 19th‑century structures: a handsome row of greystones at St‑Hubert and Viger, but which inspection has shown is unstable, which the city wants to demolish, and a building on Ste‑Catherine, already at risk of collapse, which it wants to try to save.

I notice it isn’t just age that makes buildings unstable. Radio‑Canada has a story about condos in Boisbriand built barely 15 years ago, which have been condemned because the construction was fatally flawed.
