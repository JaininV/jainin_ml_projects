The Beatnuts were not a new group on the block when they released their first project, the top notch “Intoxicated Demons: The EP”. They were affiliated with the legendary Native Tongue collective and had produced music for a slew of respected emcees like Monie Love, Common Sense and Kurious, not to mention the first LP by the young Chi Ali titled “The Fabulous Chi-Ali“. Known for digging deep in the crates to find samples, in the same vein as Large Professor or Diamond D, they created soulful and jazzy boom bap beats since the beginning of their careers. But it was time for JuJu, Psycho Les and new member Fashion to also shine on the mic with hardcore rhymes, and this is exactly what they do on this EP, released on Relativity Records in 1993. This is a short project, only six complete tracks lasting around 25 minutes, but it’s the perfect first step of a celebrated discography!
