A suspect is in custody after a car was driven through the hallways of a high school on the Stoney Nakoda First Nation west of Calgary last week.

Cochrane RCMP responded at 6:44 a.m. on April 12 to a report someone had driven a vehicle into the east side entrance of the Morley Community School.

The sedan, a blue Hyundai Elantra, was driven down several hallways, RCMP said in a release. Closed-circuit television recorded the incident.

The extensive damage was estimated to be in excess of $150,000, Mounties said.

RCMP said they will not release the suspect's identity until he is officially charged.
