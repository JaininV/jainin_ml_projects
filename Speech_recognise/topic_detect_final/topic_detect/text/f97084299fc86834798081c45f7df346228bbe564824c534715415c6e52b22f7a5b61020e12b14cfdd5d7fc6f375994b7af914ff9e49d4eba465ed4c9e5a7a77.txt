Russell Kennedy Lawyers Rosemary Southgate and Donna Rayner advise that the Victorian Government has recently announced a further period for stakeholder consultation on the Retirement Villages Amendment Bill 2022.

“As noted in our October (2022) Alert, the Bill significantly re-writes the Retirement Villages Act 1986 (Vic) and makes many fundamental changes across all stages of the resident’s journey through a village,” the lawyers write.

“The Bill makes changes to pre contract disclosure, addresses operational matters while residents live in the village, matters after residents leave the village including, reinstatement/refurbishment obligations, recovery of fees, timeframe for payment of exit entitlements, termination rights and dispute resolution processes.”

Any correspondence has to be sent to the Victorian Government by 1 May.
