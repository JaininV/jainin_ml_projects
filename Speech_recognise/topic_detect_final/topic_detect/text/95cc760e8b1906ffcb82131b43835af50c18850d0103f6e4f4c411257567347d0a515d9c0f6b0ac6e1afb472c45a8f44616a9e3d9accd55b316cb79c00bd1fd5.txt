We live in participation trophy times. Our times are fluid and weak. Men are not conditioned for competition. They think that they are owed without earning. They think that women should just love them for themselves. They are fools. Women love winners. Read on.

A woman wants to associate her identity with her male in sexual selection. This comes from a woman having a weak sense of self. She seeks a man who is confident and who has strong certainty of self because she wants to be like him and follower that frame.

Women look for winners in life whether these are popular men, rich men or talented men because women want to stand-in-the-same-spotlight with them. The men who win in life are seen as winners and women want to be seen with them.

The Wall Speaks book is about masculine frame, it teaches how to live with one woman. Frame is not about promiscuity.

A female is sensitive to social judgment. This means that if a man is getting positive attention for himself, a woman will side up along him and try to get that attention with him. If a man is winning in life, he will attract women because they are wanting to share his spotlight

Women do not care how a man has won, only that he has indeed won. A woman does not care about the hard work that it took to achieve his success only that he has success. She wants to stand with a winner only because being associated with a loser brings social shame.

When a man carries masculine frame, he is seeking respect and gets social validation for that frame. Women love framed men, because they want to share in that respect for these menâ€™s authority. Carry frame. Be strong. Be a winner and watch women flock to you.
