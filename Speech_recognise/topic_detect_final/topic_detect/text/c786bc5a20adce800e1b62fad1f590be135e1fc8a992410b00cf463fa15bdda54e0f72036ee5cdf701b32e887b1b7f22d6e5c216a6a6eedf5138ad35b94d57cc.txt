Used Koni shocks and lowering springs. They came with the car when I purchased my '96 C4S. I'm unsure of the miles, but the car had 50k miles when I bought it and it now has 51k miles. It rides very plush. If you're after something for more spirited driving, these aren't it. For the life of me, I cannot figure out what brand the springs are. It has a part number of 76048 41/07 on one of the springs.

I upgraded to some KWs. $850 shipped.
