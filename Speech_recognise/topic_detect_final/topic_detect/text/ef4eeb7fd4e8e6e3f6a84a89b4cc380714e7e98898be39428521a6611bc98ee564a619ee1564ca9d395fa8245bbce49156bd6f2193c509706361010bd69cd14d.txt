Men of the Ogun State Police Command have arrested a 33-year-old lady, who sold her 18-month-old baby for the sum of N600,000 to enable her repay “an embarrassing” bank loan.

The lady, identified as Olaide Adekunle, allegedly travelled to Lagos State on March 15, 2023 where she started hawking sachet water for the possibility of raising enough money to offset the debt she was owing a microfinance bank.

LEADERSHIP gathered that when Olaide could not raise the desired fund, she opted to selling her baby, Moridiat Rasaq, to a yet-to-be identified woman without the consent of her husband.

The Police Command’s Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Abimbola Oyeyemi, who confirmed the incident, said Olaide was arrested following a report lodged with the police at the Sango Ota Divisional headquarters by her husband, Nureni Rasaq.

Oyeyemi explained that confessional statement obtained by the police from the suspect indicated that Olaide, while hawking sachet water in Lagos met a man who introduced her to the woman that eventually bought the child from her.

The PPRO, however, disclosed that the acting Commissioner of Police in the state, Babakura Muhammed, has directed that the suspect be transferred to the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department (SCIID) for further investigation and possible recovery of the baby
