Every morning, I make it a point to do a quick mobility routine to compliment my kettlebell training. I’m not as flexible as I used to be 20 years ago, but that’s where this routine comes in. Not only does it help with flexibility and recovery, but it also clears my mind for the day ahead. I pull my routines from a bunch of different places, but one of my favorites is the 28-day Flexibility Challenge program that I shared with you yesterday. One of my favorites includes:

* Standing straddle with alternating toe reach – 3 sets of 10 reps per side

You can find the full exercise demos in the 28-day hyperbolic stretching challenge. After just a month of doing this routine, you’ll notice a major improvement in your flexibility, mobility, mindset, and just overall life. Give it a try and let me know how it goes!
