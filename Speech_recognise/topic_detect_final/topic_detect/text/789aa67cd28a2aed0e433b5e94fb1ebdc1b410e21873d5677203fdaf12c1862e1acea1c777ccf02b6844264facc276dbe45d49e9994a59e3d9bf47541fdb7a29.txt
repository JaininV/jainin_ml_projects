The Realme 11 series is expected to launch next month and tipster Ice Universe shared a look at the design of the Realme 11 series on Weibo. There’s no confirmation on which Realme 11 series phone is in the image though we can assume both the 11 Pro and 11 Pro+ will share similar designs.

The upcoming Realme flagship from the image sports a green faux leather back with a substantial circular camera ring which is expected to house a 200MP main sensor on the Pro+ model – most likely Samsung’s ISOCELL HP3. Realme 11 Pro is rumored to launch with a 108MP main unit.

Both phones are also expected to launch with curved 6.7-inch OLED displays with 120Hz refresh rates and 5,000 mAh batteries and 67W and 100W chargers. The Relme 11 Pro series is expected to launch with brand-new MediaTek Dimensity 7000-series chipsets.

In related news, Realme 11 5G (RMX3751) appeared in a certification listing on China’s TENAA database. The device features a similar-looking design to the Realme 11 Pro and 11 Pro+ on the back.

The front of the Realme 11 5G features a punch hole cutout in the top left corner of the display. There are no other spec details at the moment.
