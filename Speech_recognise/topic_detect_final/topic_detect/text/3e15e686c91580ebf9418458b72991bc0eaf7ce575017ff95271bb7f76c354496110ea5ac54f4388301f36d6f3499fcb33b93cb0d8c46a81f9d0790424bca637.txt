PUTRAJAYA, April 19, 2023:  The first step to be taken by the new chairman of Malaysian Indian Community Transformation Unit (Mitra) is to cleanse its tarnished image.

Datuk R. Ramanan told the media today that the unit’s special vehicle committee will request for the National Audit Department to carry out a full audit on Mitra.

“Once the audit has been completed, only then will Mitra be able to make the necessary decisions moving forward,” said the Sungai Buloh member of parliament.

He said the move is not going to be a witch hunt but insisted that those found to have acted irresponsibly will face the consequences of their actions.

“If they are found to be guilty of misdeeds, then I hope God can save them, because the prime minister (Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim) and I won’t forgive them. Mitra funds are for the poor. I cannot forgive those involved in misallocations,” he said.

Ramanan said the first action plans to repair Mitra’s image is to ensure that details of recipients of its funds are displayed on its official website.

“By having the information readily available online, the public will be able to see what is done with our funds and the programmes enacted.

“Before this, people used to question what Mitra does but moving forward, we will be very transparent in sharing our fund recipients and initiatives,” he said.

It was previously reported that 16 company directors were arrested by MACC for allegedly mishandling Mitra funds amounting to tens of millions of ringgit after originally applying for Mitra grants to organise programmes for the Indian community.
