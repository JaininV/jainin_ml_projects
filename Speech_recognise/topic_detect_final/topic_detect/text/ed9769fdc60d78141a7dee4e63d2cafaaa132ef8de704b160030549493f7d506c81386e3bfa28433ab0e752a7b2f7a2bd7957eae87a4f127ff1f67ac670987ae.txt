There are plenty of traditional takes on morning foods, whether that involves buttery flaky croissants, a bowl of cereal, or bacon and eggs. Pancakes and crepes show up in a range of shapes across cultures, and blintzes are just one more example of the starchy breakfast favorite. With origins likely stemming from Eastern Europe, the delicate preparation eventually became a staple of Jewish tradition.

That being said, the enjoyment of blintzes shouldn't be limited, and this classic cheese blintz with cherries recipe is the perfect way to try them. Mashed recipe developer Patterson Watkins shares this delicious dish with us and comments, "These tasty blintzes are my idea of the perfect weekend brunch/breakfast treat. No need to get out of the jammies/PJs, just casual kitchen fun." Watkins describes them as "dressed-up pancakes," and adds that they are "a little fancier than the usual breakfast, but equally scrumptious." While you can certainly whip these up for a special weekend occasion, this sweet treat is enough to make any morning memorable.
