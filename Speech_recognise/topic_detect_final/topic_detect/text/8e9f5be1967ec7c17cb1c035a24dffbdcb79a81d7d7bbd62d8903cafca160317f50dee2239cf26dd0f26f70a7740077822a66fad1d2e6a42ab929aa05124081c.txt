Athletics Ireland, along with event organiser Dublin City Harriers, have apologised to all the competitors in Sunday's Great Ireland Run for what they describe as the "unforeseen circumstances" that led to the race being less than the specified distance.

The event, which took place in the Phoenix Park, also incorporates the National 10k championship.

Athletics Ireland have said they will be in contact with all 10k competitors when further information becomes available.

Their full statement read: "Athletics Ireland and the event organiser Dublin City Harriers wish to apologise to all participants for the unforeseen circumstances that led to today's Great Ireland Run (incorporating the national 10k championship) being less than the specified distance.
