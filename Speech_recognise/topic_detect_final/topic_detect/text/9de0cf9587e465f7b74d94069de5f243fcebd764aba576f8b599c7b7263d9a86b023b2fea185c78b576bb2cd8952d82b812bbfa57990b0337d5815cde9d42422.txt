Oyo state coordinator of Oodu’a Peoples Congress (OPC), Mr. Rotimi Olumo, on Tuesday declared that he has nothing to do with the national coordinator of the group, Otunba Gani Adams.

Olumo made this disclosure while addressing journalists at a press conference in Ibadan.

Adams is the Aare Ona Kakanfo of Yoruba land.

Adams is also the national coordinator of OPC.

Olumo while addressing journalists, however, announced that he has parted ways with Adams.

He added that he has no reason for being with a leader that doesn’t trust him.

He revealed that the National Executive Council and the National Coordinating Council of the group, had on Sunday, announced the replacement of Osun State coordinator of the group, Adedeji Aladesawe, with Adeyemi Aboderin for allegedly collecting N35 million from the President-elect, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu to mobilise support for him during the election.

Olumo maintained that he was accused alongside Aladesawe of collecting money from Tinubu to mobilize support for him (Tinubu).

Olumo, while speaking further said that he has distanced himself from Adams.

The OPC coordinator who spoke further said that Adams has also accused him of collecting N35 million from Tinubu.

He maintained that these are the reasons he decided to stay clear of Adams.

He said he had decided to part ways with Adams over unsubstantiated claims.

Olumo said, “Aare Adams used to be my good leader who I trusted so much, he used to be someone I could do anything for, but it was quite unfortunate that my trust for him was betrayed.

“I actually don’t have anything personal against him but there is no point being with a leader that doesn’t trust someone. This is so annoying and painful!

“Trust is so important in any relationship! This is one of the most sensitive and important decisions of my life”.
