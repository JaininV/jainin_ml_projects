Chelsea Green has a lot of fans, and she connects with each of them on a different level. While some fans are happy to support Green with a t-shirt purchase, some fans have their own way of paying tribute.

One fan recently surprised Twitter when she tweeted out a photo of her Chelsea Green tattoos. She has three of them at this point, and she claims that they were all DIY.

This fan has Chelsea Green’s “CG” logo, a “shhhh” on her index finger, and now she has a big “HOT MESS” on her ribs. That trifecta of Chelsea Green tattoos was tweeted out along with a caption to explain her fandom.

Finally, added the Hot Mess lettering on my ribs to my ever-growing collection of @ImChelseaGreen themed stick and poke DIY tattoos

Chelsea Green did not reply outright to this message, but she does apparently encourage it. The former Hot Mess retweeted this fan’s tribute. Now, fans on Chelsea Green’s timeline will all get to take a look at this superfan’s extreme homage.

This isn’t the first big tattoo choice from a WWE fan recently. Another fan got a lot of attention with his Cody Rhodes American Nightmare replica neck tattoo.

We’ll have to see what’s next for Chelsea Green. She could have a lawsuit filed against a fan soon enough. Only time will tell how that turns out. You can check out this fan’s extreme body art below.
