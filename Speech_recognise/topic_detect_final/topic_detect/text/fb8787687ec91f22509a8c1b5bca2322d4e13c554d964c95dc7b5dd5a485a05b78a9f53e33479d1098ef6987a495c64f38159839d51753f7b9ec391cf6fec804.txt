Having been behind the wheel of countless supercars and hypercars for Jay Leno's Garage, it takes a lot to impress the American television host. On the newest episode, Jay gets to experience the all-new 2023 Cadillac Escalade V-Series with Cadillac Executive Chief Engineer Brandon Vivian. Jay Leno's passion for the American brand runs deep as he owns an array of collectible Cadillacs, including an all-original 1918 model. After a full walkaround and introduction to the track-capable Escalade, Jay hops behind the wheel to experience the 682 horsepower 6.2L Supercharged V8 firsthand.

The Escalade V-Series seems to be a tamed beast as the two enjoy luxurious amenities like premium audio, leather massaging seats, and state-of-the-art technology. Between stop lights, Jay and Brandon chat about other legendary V models like the manual transmission CTS-V wagon. Finally, Brandon has Jay set up the Cadillac Escalade V-Series in V mode to hear the incredible growl of the high-flow exhaust system. The most impressive characteristic for Jay is that Cadillac is building the Escalade V-Series the best way they can instead of just good enough. You can tell by the look on his face that Jay Leno thoroughly enjoys the quick-shifting 10-speed automatic transmission, along with it being the perfect blend between performance and luxury.
