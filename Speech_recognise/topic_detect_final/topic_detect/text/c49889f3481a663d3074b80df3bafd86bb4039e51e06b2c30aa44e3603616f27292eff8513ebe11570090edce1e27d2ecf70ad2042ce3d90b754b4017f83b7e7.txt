Indeed, it’s been quite a few months for the private actor who prefers to avoid drama. Rarely do you have anything to say about Uzalo’s Mastermind, as he stays far from social media.

Indeed, Ntokozo is not getting a speeding lesson anytime soon, as he showed some of his driving skills. A couple of years ago, he got involved in a fatal accident that left many fans thinking he was dead. Indeed, he survived, and we all thought he wouldn’t drive again: that’s not Ntokozo for you.

Ntokozo Dlamini seemed alone in his car, as recorded on the dashboard as he overtook vehicles on the highway. Despite many fans fearing another accident scare, Ntokozo seemed to be so well in control. He has the skills to balance the car; probably, he should one day seek to replace Paul Walker on Fast & Furious.

Moving from this side to another side of the road playing Zanzibar by, DJ Maphorisa geared his car. He recorded the screen as the speedometer numbers rose to above 100.

Ntokozo Dlamini overtakes every car in front as if it’s a joke or a movie. It was difficult to believe that a person who almost lost his life would continue to drive like that. This says how much Ntokozo is confident in his driving skills: an actual copy of the late Paul Walker.

As he shared on his Instagram, Ntokozo did not put any caption. Probably he knew that fans would get something to start trolling him.

Indeed, her wife, Jessica, wants to avoid seeing Ntokozo taking risks on the road. She had been there the last time he was involved in an accident, and that was the last thing she would want to hear. How can she accept that when she is carrying her baby?

Speaking of her pregnancy, Jessica Nkosi said:

God has been so so good!!! We are growing

Driving aside, Jessica and Ntokozo are growing fast and already have a big family. Sooner or later, they would be one of the power couples in Mzansi. As he grows up, Ntokozo Dlamini may stop trying to copy Paul Walker’s driving skills on highways.
