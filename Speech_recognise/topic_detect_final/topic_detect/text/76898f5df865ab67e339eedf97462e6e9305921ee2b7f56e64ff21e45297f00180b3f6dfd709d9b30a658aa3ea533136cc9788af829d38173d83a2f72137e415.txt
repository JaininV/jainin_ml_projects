Wolves are preparing to land a club-record fee for midfielder Matheus Nunes this summer after Man United joined Liverpool in the race for his signature, sources have told Football Insider.

It is believed that the Molineux club are hopeful of a bidding war for the 24-year-old, who is likely to be in high demand in the next transfer window.

Football Insider revealed on Monday (17 April) that Nunes is on the radar of Man United ahead of the summer.

Sources told this site earlier this month (7 April) that Liverpool are still pushing to sign the Portugal international – with a fee of £50million believed to be enough to land him after a release clause was removed from his Wolves contract.

Meanwhile, Newcastle and Barcelona have been widely linked with a move for the former Sporting CP ace.

A fee of £50million would represent a new club record for Wolves.

Their previous record sale was the reported £40million fee paid by Liverpool for star forward Diogo Jota in 2020.

Nunes signed for Wolves just last summer (2022) in a reported club-record initial £38million deal and penned a five-year deal at Molineux.

As per FBRef, the 24-year-old earns a wage of £85,000-a-week.

He has turned out 32 times for Wolves across all competitions, scoring once.

The midfielder has plied his trade in a range of positions this season, including central midfield and on the left flank.

Wolves have pulled clear of relegation danger since the appointment of Julen Lopetegui late last year (2022), and now sit 13th – seven points clear of the drop zone.

Eighth-place Liverpool are unlikely to sneak into the Premier League’s top four this term but could qualify for European competition with a top-seven finish.

Man United and Newcastle are well-placed to qualify for next season’s Champions League group stage.
