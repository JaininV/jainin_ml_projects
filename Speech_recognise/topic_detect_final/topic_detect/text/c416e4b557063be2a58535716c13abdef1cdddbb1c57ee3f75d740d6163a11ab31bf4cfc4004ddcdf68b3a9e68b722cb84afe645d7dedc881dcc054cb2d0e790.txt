A promo by Cora Jade during this week’s episode of WWE NXT has had fans talking due to its allusions to CM Punk and AJ Lee.

After NXT Women’s Champion Indi Hartwell retained against Zoey Stark last week, the Australian Superstar was attacked by Jade.

This week, Jade opened her promo with “Do I have everybody’s attention now?” paying homage to Punk, who used the line during the summer of 2011.

Jade ended her promo by saying “I am the hero of this story,” echoing the words AJ Lee spoke prior to Paige/Saraya’s WWE Raw debut in April 2014.

Punk would infamously walk out of WWE in January 2014 while AJ Lee would part ways with the promotion the following year.
