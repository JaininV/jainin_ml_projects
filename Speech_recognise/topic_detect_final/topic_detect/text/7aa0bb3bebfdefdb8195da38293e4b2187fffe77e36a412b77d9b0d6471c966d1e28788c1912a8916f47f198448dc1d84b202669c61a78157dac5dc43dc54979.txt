At the end of Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, Kang was revealed to have countless variants from endless realities joining together to take over reality itself.

As a result, the Guardians will likely come across the conquerer on their journey, right?

Well, apparently not, according to Gunn.

The director was recently quizzed on his Instagram about the contents of his upcoming movie. He has already confirmed it his final picture with Marvel and his character, the Guardians, bringing his trilogy to a conclusion once and for all. But when asked about Kang and the multiverse, he did not mince words about what was going to happen.

He said: "Vol 3 is about ending the story of these Guardians, not about setting up anything else."
