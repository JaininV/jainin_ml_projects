“This is HMRC. A letter that was sent to you has been returned,” advises an automated lady caller with a transatlantic accent. “We are launching legal proceedings against you. Press 1 to speak to our legal officer.”

The accent and terminology give the game away instantly for anyone with a basic knowledge of UK tax, but “Press 1 to talk” scam calls are still being made in HMRC’s name nearly four years after frankfx raised the alert in Any Answers.

The underlying approach is even older, with members sharing details in 2016 and 2018 of callers chasing alleged HMRC debts who would give a landline number for the recipient call. In the succeeding years, mobile operators introduced premium call options that enhanced the convenience and potential revenue of the scam, so fraudsters could make money from extra mobile fees even if they couldn’t trick the mark into paying or divulging their bank details.

Some AccountingWEB members shared notes in 2021 about what happens when you press 1 to talk to someone, but HMRC advice is to hang up and report the details via an online form.

According to HMRC, other scam calls using this technique refer to national insurance number fraud or offer a tax refund and request bank or credit card information. As the tax department advises, if you cannot verify the identity of the caller, it’s best not to speak to them.

“Pressing 1 typically also adds your phone number to a subset of the database they’re using (marked as something like ‘potentially gullible’), so you can then expect many more calls,” added Hugo Fair.
