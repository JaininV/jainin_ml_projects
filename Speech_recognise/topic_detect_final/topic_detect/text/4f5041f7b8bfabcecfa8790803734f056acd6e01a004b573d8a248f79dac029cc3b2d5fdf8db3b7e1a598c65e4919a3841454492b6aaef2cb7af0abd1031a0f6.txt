On Tuesday, U. S. Representative Val Hoyle announced her selected projects to submit to the U.S. House Appropriations Committee as candidates to receive funding in Fiscal Year 2024.

A release said each House member was allowed to submit 15 community projects to be considered for federal funding on behalf of their congressional district. All submitted projects must be passed out of all relevant committees to be voted on by both chambers of Congress. While none of the projects are guaranteed to make it through this process, those selected by Congresswoman’s office had strong community support and were able to demonstrate to her office that they have the potential to benefit Oregon’s Fourth Congressional District, according to the release.

Projects fall in the categories of: Environment, Healthcare, Infrastructure, Rural Development and Housing, and Public Safety.

Two projects are in Douglas County:

*$2 million for Glide Revitalization. Funds would be used to renovate a warehouse into a community resource center that will provide affordable childcare, office space for social service agencies and caseworkers, a local library, a shared community conference room, youth after-school programs, a youth technical development program, and temporary shelter space during emergencies.

*$1.2 million for the Kellogg Rural Fire District. The money would be used to build a main fire station that is centrally located. The district currently has two 2-bay garages that house some of their fire apparatus, but these garages have no training room and limited facilities.
