Even with high-end gems and gold, handcrafted and multi-strand necklaces are becoming ever so popular again. Here at Argo find beautiful vintage torsades of gemstones and pearls and the mix of a mother of pearl and yellow gold station necklace. Also in this category we see more and more torsade necklaces becoming popular again. Also seen on the runway are gemstones intertwined with pearls, a truly beachy vibe!

Rarity, beauty and durability make jewelry most desirable. To differentiate the look and control the quality even more, consider a custom piece using gemstones you choose. A surprise favorite this season is bi-color watermelon tourmaline. Highlighted below, also note the one-of-a-kind asymmetric black boulder opal ring with atypical diamond surround.

Enamel, colored gems or even these exceptional hand-enameled porcelain Victorian earrings…color is everything this season.

Forever a fun spring and summer metal, we see a huge uptick in sterling this Spring – perhaps the most popular trend this year. We love that it is truly wearable on and off the runway. So grab your old sterling items and give them a polish, and collect some new basics like cuffs, personalizing them with engraving.

Earrings that are so long they graze the shoulders. Obviously more approachable in sterling, we also love these yellow gold options, well-priced at $350. A simple, elegant and of course, sparkly chain approximately 4 inches in length, almost looks like a golden strand of hair.

While you’re out in the beautiful Spring air, stop by and see us – we’d love to show you these and many other Spring styles! Have fun exploring our website: argolehne.com for lots of ideas to compliment your style.
