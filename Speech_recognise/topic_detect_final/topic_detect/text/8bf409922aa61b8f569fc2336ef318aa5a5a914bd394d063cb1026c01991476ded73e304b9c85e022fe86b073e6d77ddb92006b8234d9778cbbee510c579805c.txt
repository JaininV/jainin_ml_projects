Eddie Hearn, the promoter of former heavyweight champion Anthony Joshua, has announced that Joshua will not return to the ring until December. The plan was for Joshua to fight three times this year, starting with Jermaine Franklin in his first match.

However, it seems that the only fight remaining will be in the twelfth month of the year.

On social media, Joshua revealed that he is currently dealing with an injury and will likely not be able to fight in the summer.

However, Dillian Whyte, a fellow heavyweight fighter, does not believe Joshua's claims. At one point, Whyte was the front runner for Joshua's next opponent, but Hearn stated that the most likely candidates are now Fury and Wilder.

Whyte said, "That's a lie. Joshua ain't gonna wait until December to fight. If he's not injured, why would he wait until December to fight? Joshua just thinks he's some sort of mystery man nowadays. He thinks he's f------ Martin Luther King or something, you know."  Whyte also added, "No one believes it.

Anyone that believes that is an idiot. Why would he not fight until December when he can potentially get three fights this year?"

Despite Whyte's skepticism, Hearn confirmed that Joshua's next fight will take place in December in the Middle East.

Hearn stated, "For AJ, one thing's for sure, his big fight will be in December, and that will be Tyson Fury or Deontay Wilder. That's what we're planning."  Hearn also said, "Our focus is to get that mega fight in December over the line.

There is no official decision in terms of whether AJ would fight in July. Some of that might come around the deal or the decision or the completion of that fight in December."    While Joshua's injury has temporarily delayed his return to the ring, big plans are in the works for his December showdown with either Fury or Wilder.

The focus is on getting this "fight of huge proportion" over the line, and a decision regarding a potential July fight will be made in the coming weeks.
