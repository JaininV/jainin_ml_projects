Grapes Shot is a refreshing summer drink with Indian twist. Here is the recipe to make it easily at home.

Summer brings the juiciest of  fruits, grapes is one of them. The grapes we found this year were extremely sweet and refreshing.

One such summer drink we often enjoy is the grapes shot. It is refreshing and ideal to serve as a mid-day drink.

Shot  or shooter is a small size of mixed drink usually consumed in one go. It is made of different kinds with alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks.

Grapes are  rich in nutrients and anti-oxidants. They are  a good source of Vitamin B6, Vitamin C, Copper, Vitamin K and fiber. It is ideal in weight management. It also helps in preventing constipation. It may protect diabetes and help in controlling blood sugar.

It is always good to eat whole fruits rather juice. They are filling and provide more nutrients to the body. Ultimately, it is seasonal fruits which should be consumed often and in larger quantities than juices.

* In a blender, put the grapes and a few ice cubes, give a blitz.

* Now, add black salt and pepper powder to it. Blend it once more and pour in the glass.

Shots is usually served in small glasses. Rub the rim with lemon juice and dip in a little salt. It gives a good look and a nice taste to it.

* Black grapes can also be used.

* Sugar may be added, it depends on the sweetness of the fruit. I have not added here.

* Do not add water, shots is generally thick in consistency.

Sending this to Healthy Summer Drinks at Shhh Secretly Cooking Challenge group. The theme was suggested by Sasmita Sahoo Samanta. I loved her drink Sabja Lemonade , which I have bookmarked to make in the near future.

Here, we are paired and the partners exchange secret ingredients. The dish is prepared as per the theme and shared in the group. My partner was Kalyani.
