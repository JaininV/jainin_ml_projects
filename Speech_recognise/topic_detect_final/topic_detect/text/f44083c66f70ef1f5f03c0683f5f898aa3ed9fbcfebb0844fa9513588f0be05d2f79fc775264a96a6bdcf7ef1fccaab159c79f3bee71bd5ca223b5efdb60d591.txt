BLOEMFONTEIN - The Free State ANC is heading to court this week to challenge the election of Papi Mokoena as the new mayor of Mangaung.

Mokoena was elected unopposed on Friday after the ANC decided to boycott the special council sitting while the party's former councillors attended the meeting.

Free State ANC spokesperson Jabu Mbalula said they are concernedÂ about the state of development in Mangaung Metro which impact on service delivery.

"We're going to court and the bases of this move is that last week Friday, there was a council meeting of Mangaung that took place and in that council meeting seven former ANC councillors participated," Mbalula said.

"And according to us, they were not supposed to be part and parcel of the council because the organisation has taken a decision that they are no more members of the organisation."
