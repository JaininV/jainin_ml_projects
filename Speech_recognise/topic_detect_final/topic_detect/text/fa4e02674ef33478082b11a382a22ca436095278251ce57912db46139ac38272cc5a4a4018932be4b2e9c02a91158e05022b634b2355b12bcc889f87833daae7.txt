COLUMBUS- The Columbus Area Children’s Museum board of directors announced additional funds are needed in order to open its doors this fall.

A capital campaign which began quietly in 2022 has raised over $945,000 of its $3 million goal with a combination of in-kind and cash donations as well as pledges over the next three to five years. In 2020, Columbus voters approved a $10 million bond issue for the construction of the community building that will house the new children’s museum along with Columbus Public Library, Columbus Arts Council, coffee shop and City of Columbus offices. While the bond is paying for the building of the shell, the development and build-out of the exhibits, lease fees for the space and operations must be raised from private and corporate donations.
