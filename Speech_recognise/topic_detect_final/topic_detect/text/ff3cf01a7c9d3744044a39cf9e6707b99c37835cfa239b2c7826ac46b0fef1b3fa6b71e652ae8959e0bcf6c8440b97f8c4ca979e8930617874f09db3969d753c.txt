Williston's Cultural Corridor Committee is seeking artists to submit designs prior to a community event scheduled for Saturday, May 13, 2023. This project is located on the 4th Street West Cultural Corridor between Main Street and 2nd Avenue West.

"Art on the Street, a Community Block Party" is a free event to be held on May 13 in the Service Drug Parking lot (300 block off 1st Avenue West), adjacent to 4th Street.
