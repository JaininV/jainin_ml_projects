And down the memory hole this story goes....

Main stream has already forgot about it.....does fit their narrative. Saying this nicely...wink.

Except for regionally, this was memory holed immediately. A general description of the perps was well known, even though the motives werenâ€™t. This story got no legs because it is more like an average weekend in Chicago, than what the media is searching for to prop up a narrative.
