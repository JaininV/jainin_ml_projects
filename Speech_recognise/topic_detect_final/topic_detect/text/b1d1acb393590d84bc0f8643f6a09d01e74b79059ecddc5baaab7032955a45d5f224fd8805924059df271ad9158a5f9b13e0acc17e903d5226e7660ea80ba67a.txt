For 25 years, Bluesfest has been held at Oak Grove Park in Gladstone, MO in the month of June. For the 26th year that is all changing to a new month and venue. On May 19 & 20 The Gladstone Summertime Bluesfest will be in beautiful downtown Linden Square in Gladstone, MO.

What brought the changes was to avoid the heat in June and smaller crowds at the festival since the pandemic. There are also advantages to this location since it has a more intimate setting to the stage and the concession stand is behind the audience.

Over the years, multiple volunteers and Sponsors have helped to bring this festival to the Gladstone community. With the support of Sponsors and the help of donations at the gate, this event has been free to the public. Businesses or individuals do not have to be members of the Gladstone Area Chamber to be a sponsor of Gladstone Summertime Bluesfest. There are perks to having a sponsorship and there are different levels too. Itâ€™s a great way to promote your business while supporting the Blues artists that will be performing that weekend.

Gladstone Summertime Bluesfest will be held at Linden Square in Gladstone, Missouri on May 19 & 20, 2023. Friday from 6 p.m. to 11 p.m. and Saturday from 5 p.m. to 11 p.m..
