Several nations are approaching electrification from different perspectives, with the aim of either increasing the demand for electricity or the (renewable) electricity share in the total energy supply. Some countries, mainly emerging countries, are also addressing the distribution network as well as setting targets for the part of the population which is linked to the electricity grid or growing the capacity of the system.  In recent years, several regions are engaged in strengthening their network of electricity, including the European Union, the U.S., Hungary, and India having well-established funds to achieve this. Recently, Sweden published a strategy concentrated only on electrification and further how to enable it. It concentrates on the expansion of EV charging networks, increasing grid capacity, and developing the wind energy sector. Similarly, Japan issued an inclusive response regarding the power shortages. Australia and Canada have started to fund smart- and micro-grid demonstration projects to improve the reliability and resilience of the power grid. Hence, the increase in electrification-related policy measures is expected to propel the global electrification market growth during the forecast period.

As electrification turns an even larger portion of creating the ultimate energy consumption into electricity, it represents two different difficulties for the electrification market. The first is financial; that is, utilities and resource aggregators must ensure their value proposals to residential and commercial consumers are capable enough to win their support. The second difficulty is a technical challenge related to electrification that lies in the non-uniformity and complexity of buildings, thereby making it more challenging for their management in a scalable manner. This is anticipated to restrict the market growth during the forecast period.  The advancements in technologies are anticipated to offer numerous growth opportunities over the forecast period. The improvement of smart grid technology has significantly opened up endless possibilities for improved electric power transmission, generation, and distribution. It can be more quickly installed as compared to conventional grids and also occupy less area because of its adaptability.  These advancements in energy storage systems for cost reduction and increased efficiency make it easy to combine renewable energy sources into the grid. The aim of the smart grid design model is to make the grid more observable, improve the security and performance of the power system, make assets controllable, and particularly improve the financial elements of planning, operations, and maintenance.  The renewable energy segment dominated the global electrification market in 2022. The environmental regulations in both developing and developed countries are anticipated to contribute to segment growth in the coming years. Moreover, the segment growth is largely enhanced due to the rising pressure to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and growing environmental concerns. Additionally, the technological improvements in solar PV production and energy storage systems are likely to present huge prospects for segment growth. The fossil fuels segment is projected to expand at a significant CAGR over the forecast period. The increased population worldwide has led to an increase in demand for energy, particularly in emerging economies.  The transportation segment dominated the global electrification market in 2022 with the largest revenue share. As awareness about air pollution and climate change is rising, the pressure to reduce carbon emissions in the transportation sector is increasing. Furthermore, policies and incentives are being increasingly implemented by several countries in order to promote the usage of EVs as well as other electric transportation technology. In addition, these include credits, tax breaks, and requirements for which automakers create a definite number of zero-emission automobiles. All these factors are expected to support the segment’s growth.
