To help organizations achieve more with less, Oracle is introducing new capabilities across Oracle Fusion Cloud Applications Suite that help customers accelerate supply chain planning, increase operational efficiency, and improve financial accuracy. The updates include new planning, usage based pricing, and rebate management capabilities within Oracle Fusion Cloud Supply Chain & Manufacturing (SCM) and enhanced quote-to-cash processes in Oracle Fusion Applications.

Many organizations struggle with disconnected systems that require complex and costly integrations, which slow down business processes and impact financial accuracy and profitability. To address these challenges and improve the speed and accuracy of insights, organizations need an integrated platform that enables AI and automation to be embedded in supply chain processes.

“The last few years have highlighted the value of supply chain insights, efficiency, and accuracy, and the consequences of moving too slow when a disruption occurs,” says Jon Chorley, senior vice president of supply chain applications and chief sustainability officer, Oracle. “With Oracle’s complete suite of integrated applications, organizations can manage supply chain data on the same platform as finance, HR, and customer experience to accelerate processes like quote-to-cash and remove barriers that have traditionally existed between different business functions. This holistic approach creates an environment where AI and automation can flourish to help businesses drive efficiencies and achieve more with less.”

* New AI-powered lead time estimates in Oracle Supply Chain Planning: Help customers improve the accuracy of lead time assumptions by using machine learning to highlight variances based on actual performance. Embedded in Oracle Supply Chain Planning’s Planning Advisor, the new feature can improve planning efficiency and results by identifying lead time trends, anomalies, and their potential impact with prioritized actions and resolution suggestions.

* Enhanced quote-to-cash process in Oracle Fusion Applications: Helps customers centralize subscription orchestration and usage ratings, comply with accounting requirements, improve order management, reduce costs and time to market, and provide a seamless customer experience. The integrated solution connecting Subscription Management (CX), Configure Price and Quote (CX), Order Management (SCM) and Financials (ERP), enables customers to quote, capture, and fulfill orders (of mixed physical goods, subscriptions and services) more efficiently and recognize revenue accordingly.

* New rebate management capabilities in Oracle Channel Revenue Management: Help customers streamline rebate programs, improve audit claim accuracy, and gain better visibility into program performance. Part of Oracle Channel Revenue Management, the new capabilities automate the rebate management process from rebate calculation through to financial settlement to help improve payment accuracy, reduce administration costs, and enable customer claims to be quickly settled.
