Recently, Pertamina's Plaju refinery workers launched the E-Workshop 2.0 application â€“ the latest digital solution for efficient refinery maintenance process.

This Go Live event was attended by representatives from PT KPI headquarters, RU II Dumai, RU IV Cilacap, RU VI Balongan, and RU VII Kasim, as well as the General Manager and all the Management and Section Heads of Pertamina Plaju refinery.

Yulianto Triwibowo, General Manager of Pertamina Plaju Refinery, appreciated the e-Workshop program for successfully launching E-Workshop 2.0 at the refinery. Yulianto said that if this e-Workshop program can be implemented well, it will be remarkable.

Yulianto also emphasised that the e-Workshop application must be well-organised from start to finish, from administration to execution, to pave the way for other applications development that can record every completed task and ensure the work is meaningful.

He also believed that the workers at Pertamina Plaju refinery are capable of being leaders and innovators in advancing the refinery in the digital era.

Eko Sunarno, Vice President of Reliability of PT KPI, explained that the e-Workshop is one of the links in the chain of reliability management, and it also reflects how maintenance is managed.
