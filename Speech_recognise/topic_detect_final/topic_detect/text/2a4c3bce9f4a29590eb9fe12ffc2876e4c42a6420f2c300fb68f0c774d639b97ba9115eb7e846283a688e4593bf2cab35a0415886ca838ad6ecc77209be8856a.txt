After played a negative character in a web show, actor Dino Morea once again is treating us to his baddie stance in his Telugu debut film ‘Agent’. Dino’s first poster from the film is out.

This look is that there is something very cool about this antagonist. He looks suave, deadly, and all ready to daunt you. In fact, that long mane only makes us recall Dino’s Shaibani Khan avatar, with this one being a modern rendition.

Talking about his role and his look, Dino says, “Being a baddie is never easy, especially when people have seen you in that lover boy image for the longest. But in Agent, I got to explore my love for action. Yes, I will be doing some high-octane action in this one. I am sure people will like this one as much as they like Shaibani Khan, in fact, even more.”

Agent is a spy thriller, directed by Surender Reddy. It also stars Mammootty and Akhil Akkineni along with Dino Morea as the antagonist.

Other than that, Dino is also making his Malayalam debut with the film ‘Bandra‘. The film also stars Dileep and Tamannaah Bhatia.
