Chelsea are reportedly set to appoint a permanent manager following the club’s exit from the Champions League.

Current champions Real Madrid beat Chelsea 2-0 at Stamford Bridge on Tuesday night and 4-0 on aggregate to dump Chelsea out of the Champions League.

According to Sky Germany, the Chelsea hierarchy favour Julian Nagelsmann ahead of Luis Enrique for the managerial job at Stamford Bridge.

Chelsea’s co-sporting directors Paul Winstanley and Laurence Stewart had a face-to-face meeting with Nagelsmann last week.

The report claims that talks were positive and although a final decision has not been made, it’s understood that Chelsea have Nagelsmann ahead of Luis Enrique at this point.
