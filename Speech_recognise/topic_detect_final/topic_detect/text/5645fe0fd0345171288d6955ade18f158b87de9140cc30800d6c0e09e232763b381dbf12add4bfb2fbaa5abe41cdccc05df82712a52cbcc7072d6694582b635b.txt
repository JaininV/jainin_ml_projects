Alabama football could have as many as four players selected in the first round of the NFL Draft.

Brian Branch, a talented defensive back, is one of the best players in the draft. As a former four-star, the native Georgian was highly impactful in three seasons for the Crimson Tide. He enjoyed a productive junior year, finishing third on the team for tackles (90) and having 14 tackles for loss, three sacks, seven pass breakups, two quarterback hurries, and two interceptions.

Branch helped the Tide win a College Football Playoff National Championship as a freshman in 2020. He would capture a Southeastern Conference Championship ring in 2021. The 6-foot, 190-pounder assisted Alabama to 11 victories last year, including a win over Kansas State in the Allstate Sugar Bowl. In last week’s airing of “Hey Coach,” Malachi Moore gave his teammate a glowing NFL Draft scouting report. Moore, an Alabama native, shared why teams need to take Branch.

“You are getting a dog,” Moore said about why NFL teams should consider Branch. “You are getting someone that is going to come in and work every day. He is going to give it his all. He is the ultimate competitor, and he’s a great tackler. He can cover, he can really do everything on the field. You are getting an outstanding player in Brian Branch.”

Nick Saban as Branch’s head coach for the Crimson Tide would echo Moore’s words.

We will see which team decides to take Branch in the draft.
