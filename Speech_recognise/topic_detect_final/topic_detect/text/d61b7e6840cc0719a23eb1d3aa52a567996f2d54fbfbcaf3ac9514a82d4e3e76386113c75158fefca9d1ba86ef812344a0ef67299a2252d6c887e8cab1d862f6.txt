Basketball Australia was between a rock and a hard place. There are many points along that axis and they are all fraught. Wherever BA landed, it was going to disappoint someone. In this instance, it is transgender player Lexi Rodgers.

It is now generally accepted that gender exists on a spectrum. It is also accepted that sport is divided into competitions for men and women. That means a line has to be drawn somewhere, and wherever it is, some will justifiably feel that they are on the wrong side.

What has become increasingly clear is that line is not and cannot always be drawn in the same place, that its position will move as science and society moves, and that there may never be a precise and immutable place for it. There may never be a magic bullet.

Without specifying the grounds on which it turned down Rodgers, BA acknowledged this inherent fluidity in its statement, saying it â€œassesses eligibility of prospective elite-level transgender athletes on a case-by-case basis, accounting for and balancing a range of factors.
