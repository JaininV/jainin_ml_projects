April 19. Mecklenburg County has partnered with The Lee Institute to help facilitate the corporate rentals/landlord community engagement effort including one in Huntersville on Thursday, April 20.

These efforts include public participation experiences, including a survey and open houses, virtual and in-person.

The public is invited to share experiences, ideas and suggestions related to corporate-owned rentals and corporate landlords during a meeting at Huntersville Town Hall, 101 Huntersville-Concord Road,  6:30-7:30 pm tomorrow.

The purpose of the open house meeting is to listen to the public’s insights and experiences related to corporate-owned, single-family homes. The Lee Institute’s hope is to better understand Charlotte-Mecklenburg community members’ experiences with corporate-owned rentals and corporate landlords. Even if you don’t live in a home owned by a corporate landlord, the institute would still like to hear your thoughts.

Registration  is not required, but is encouraged to help plan meeting materials.
