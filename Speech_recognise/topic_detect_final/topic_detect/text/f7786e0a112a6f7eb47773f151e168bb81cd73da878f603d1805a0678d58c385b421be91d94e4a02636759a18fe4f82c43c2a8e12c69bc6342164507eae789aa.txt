Chelsea legend Gary Cahill has revealed why former Chelsea boss Graham Potter and current boss Frank Lampard have both struggled to win games at Chelsea.

Cahill told Daily Mail: “I think it’s so difficult to manage a massive squad of individual players who, let’s be honest… they’re international players with big egos who think they should start games.

“To manage that is very difficult because you’ve got to leave a lot of players in the stands. I did feel a little bit sorry when Graham Potter had the job.

“He tried to manage the squad that he had at the time and then more are getting added into the mix and it’s almost like ‘how do I juggle this?’.

“I think that’s a tough job. But I think for the Madrid game, whoever is selected to start, and be on the bench, will be so motivated to go out there.”
