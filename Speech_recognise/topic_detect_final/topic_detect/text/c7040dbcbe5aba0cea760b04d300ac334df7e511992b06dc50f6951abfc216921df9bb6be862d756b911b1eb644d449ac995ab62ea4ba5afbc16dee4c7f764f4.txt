A bill “would limit what can be taught on Tennessee college campuses,” WMC-TV reports.

“Professors and students on Tennessee college and university campuses could face penalties for discussing topics that the bill calls divisive.”

“The bill lists 17 different divisive topics not to be discussed such as whether one race or sex is inherently superior or inferior to another race or sex. It also bans teaching an individual by virtue of the individual’s race or sex is inherently privileged, racist, sexist, or oppressive, whether consciously or unconsciously.”
