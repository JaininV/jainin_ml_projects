All Missouri school buildings could have bullet-resistant doors and windows on them. The Missouri House has approved a wide-ranging public safety bill that would cover first floor entryways and windows large enough for an intruder to get through. House Democratic Leader Crystal Quade, of Springfield, says the Republican-controlled Legislature should be restricting access to guns for children and mentally ill people.

State Representative Chad Perkins, a Republican from Bowling Green, says the move would designate state funding to protect public schools. The price tag could range from 5.5-million-dollars to substantially more.
