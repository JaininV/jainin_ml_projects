Westford USA, April  18, 2023  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The market for Industrial Catalytic Converters is projected to achieve a value of USD 20.52 billion by 2030, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5% during the forecast period (2023-2030). This growth is driven by government regulations, increasing industrialization, rising environmental consciousness, technological advancements, and cost savings. The surge in industrialization in developing countries such as China and India has resulted in a rise in industrial emissions, leading to an upsurge in demand for catalytic converters to reduce emissions and comply with regulations. A report by SkyQuest highlights that air pollution in China leads to 1.1 million premature deaths each year, and costs the country about 5.8% of its GDP. Similarly, air pollution in India is responsible for more than 1.6 million deaths annually, per the Lancet Commission's report.

SkyQuest's recent research has shown that installing catalytic converters in industrial boilers can result in energy savings of up to 5%. The increasing awareness about the impact of industrial emissions on the environment and public health has further intensified the demand for industrial catalytic converters. A survey conducted by the European Environment Agency found that air pollution is the primary environmental concern for European citizens, with 80% of them considering it a significant issue.

Industrial catalytic converters are crucial in reducing harmful emissions from industrial processes, promoting environmental sustainability, and helping industries comply with strict environmental regulations. They improve air quality and minimize the negative impact of industrial activities on human health and the environment. With the increasing awareness of environmental issues and the urgent need to address climate change, the significance of industrial catalytic converters has only grown more prominent in today's time.

Oil Refining Application Segment to Drive Higher Sales as the Refining Process Generates Substantial Emissions

A recent analysis found that the Main Landing Gear segment played a significant role in the rapid development of the Industrial Catalytic Converter market in 2021. This trend is predicted to continue from 2022 to 2030, as the refining process generates substantial emissions, including sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and carbon monoxide (CO). A study published in the Journal of Cleaner Production recently discovered that catalytic converters were effective in reducing emissions from petroleum refining processes, including nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulfur dioxide (SO2). The study also noted that catalytic converters were increasingly important in meeting emissions regulations and reducing environmental impacts.

According to SkyQuest, North America is expected to become a dominant player in the Industrial Catalytic Converter market from 2022 to 2030, with a projected CAGR of 7.82% during the forecast period. This growth is driven by the increasing demand for clean energy sources like natural gas and renewable energy, as well as strict regulations in the region. In the United States, the Clean Air Act (CAA) regulates industrial emissions and establishes National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for air pollutants. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) enforces the CAA and has implemented various regulations to reduce emissions from industries, including the mandatory use of pollution control equipment like catalytic converters. Additionally, the EPA has established the National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) program, which sets emission standards for various industrial sectors and requires the use of pollution control equipment like catalytic converters.
