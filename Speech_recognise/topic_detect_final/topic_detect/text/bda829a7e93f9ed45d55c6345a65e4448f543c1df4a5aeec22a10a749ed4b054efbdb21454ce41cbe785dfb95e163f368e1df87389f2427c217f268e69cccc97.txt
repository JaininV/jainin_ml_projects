CHELSEA target Giorgi Mamardashvili will reportedly quit Valencia this summer, opening the door for the Blues.

The London club have been linked to the young goalkeeper as speculation mounts that they could make a change in between the sticks.

But Tottenham have also been linked to the 22-year-old and now the rivals could be set to duel for Mamardashvili's signature.

Fabrizio Romano reports that the Georgian keeper will leave struggling Valencia this summer, even though he extended his contract to 2027 last September.

The transfer expert tweeted: "Georgian goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili, expected to leave Valencia in any case at the end of the season despite contract extension signed few months ago."

He adds that Chelsea and Spurs are "monitoring" his development while reporting that Leicester have already met the player's agent this month.

The Blues have veered between Kepa Arrizabalaga and Edouard Mendy for the last few seasons as their main No1 but both have failed to convince.

Meanwhile Tottenham are believed to be in the market for Hugo Lloris' long-term replacement.

And Leicester have yet to bring in a first-team goalkeeper since letting Kasper Schmeichel leave last summer.

Mamardashvili has been ever-present in Valencia's team in La Liga this season after joining the club in 2021 from Dinamo Tbilisi.
