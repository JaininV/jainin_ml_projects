“Those who expect to reap the blessings of freedom, must, like men, undergo the fatigues of supporting it.” Thomas Paine – "Limitation is essential to authority. A government is legitimate only if it is effectively limited." ~ Lord Acton – Commentary on what interests me, reflecting my personal take on the world

L. A. Law is an American legal drama television series that ran for eight seasons on NBC, from September 15, 1986, to May 19, 1994.[1]

Created by Steven Bochco and Terry Louise Fisher,[2] it centers on the partners, associates and staff of a Los Angeles law firm. The show contains many of Bochco’s trademark features, including an ensemble cast, large number of parallel storylines, social drama, and off-the-wall humor.[3] It reflects the social and cultural ideologies that were occurring when the show was produced in the 1980s and early 1990s, and many of the cases featured on the show dealt with hot-button issues such as capital punishment, abortion, racism, homophobia, sexual harassment, HIV/AIDS, and domestic violence.[4][5][6] The series often also reflects social tensions between the wealthy senior lawyer protagonists and their less well–paid junior staff.
