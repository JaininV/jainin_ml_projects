The Gombe State chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) on Tuesday expelled the former Governor of the state, Senator Muhammad Danjuma Goje from the party over alleged anti-party activities.

This was contained in a statement on Tuesday after a press conference by the APC ward chairman, Tanimu Abdullahi in Kashere area of the state.

Abdullahi stated that the party took a unanimous decision to expel Goje after finding him guilty of anti-party activities.

“The activities include his failure to attend the Gombe State APC rally presided over by the national chairman Abdullahi Adamu, failure to attend the presidential campaign rally in Gombe State which was attended by the president and vice president-elect,” he said.

The ex-governor was also accused of boycotting all campaign tours of the party in his senatorial zone, Akko federal constituency, state assembly and ward units.

Other offences allegedly committed by Goje include: “making pronouncements that undermine the APC administration in the state and sponsoring a campaign of calumny with the intention of inciting the public against the APC administration in the state.”
