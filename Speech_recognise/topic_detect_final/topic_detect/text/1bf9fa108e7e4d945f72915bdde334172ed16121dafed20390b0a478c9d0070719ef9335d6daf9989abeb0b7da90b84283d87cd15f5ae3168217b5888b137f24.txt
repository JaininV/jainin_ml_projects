STUDENTS at Yahl Primary School have found a colourful way to raise money and finish term one in style.

Taking part in a colour run, the students arrived at school wearing pure white, but left covered in every colour of the rainbow.

Principal Chris Morrison said the event raised about $6500 which would go towards new, much-needed playground equipment.

“We need desperately to get some new playground equipment, we’ve got lots of the playground falling apart and we’ve also got some activity things we want to purchase,” she said.

“We’ve done a slime run and a colour run in the past and they were really enjoyed by children so we thought we’d do it again.”

Ms Morrison was hopeful new playground equipment could be purchased before the year was up.

“I can only say a very colourful day and a massive big thank you to all the families at Yahl Primary School, because less than three days ago we virtually had no money raised and… at this stage we are looking at $6500, that’s just out of this world crazy,” she said.

“It’s what Yahl’s all about, you put something like this on and this amazing community comes out to support you.”

Running around the obstacle course the students had a blast as they were sprayed with coloured water.

As they ran students were heard saying, “I look like a skittle rainbow”; “I am a Teletubby” and “I look like a pinata threw up”.

The principal even joined in with the fun and came out coated in colour, she said it was a great way to end term one.

“It’s been a very long term and a very, very, very busy term and what a great way to finish on a real high,” she said.

“It was probably the best day ever.”

Ms Morrison said the money raised at the colour run would be combined with money raised at last year’s spring fair.

“So rather than buy those cheap things, we’ve now got a chance to combine those two wonderful fundraisers and really get what the kids need,” she said.
