Bucks forward Giannis Antetokounmpo was upgraded from doubtful to questionable hours before Game 2 of the first-round Eastern Conference playoff series with the Miami Heat in Milwaukee on Wednesday.

The official team injury report released on gameday comes as Bucks head coach Mike Budenholzer transparently implied the two rest days between games 1 and 2 in the series was working in Milwaukee’s favor.

“I mean, I think if I’m being honest, I think there is an optimism (that Giannis Antetokounmpo will play in Game 2). Time is a little bit on our side, but I think that equation will flip, so yeah, I would say we’re optimistic,” Budenholzer said Tuesday night.

Milwaukee lost to the No. 8 seed Heat, 130-117, on Sunday, and Antetokounmpo exited in the first half after landing on his lower back on a drive to the basket.

He was fouled with 4:13 left in the first quarter, made one of the two ensuing free throws and stayed in the game before going to the locker room with 1:46 left in the period.

He re-entered the game with 9:56 left in the second quarter, but returned to the locker room less than two minutes later.

Heat coach Eric Spoelstra said Miami prepared for both scenarios — including a full-strength Giannis — in film sessions before Game 2.

Miami is without guard Tyler Herro due to a fractured right hand. He was injured in Game 1 and officially ruled out on the injury report.

Point guard Kyle Lowry is questionable with left knee soreness but said Wednesday he’s ready to go “with no limitations.”
