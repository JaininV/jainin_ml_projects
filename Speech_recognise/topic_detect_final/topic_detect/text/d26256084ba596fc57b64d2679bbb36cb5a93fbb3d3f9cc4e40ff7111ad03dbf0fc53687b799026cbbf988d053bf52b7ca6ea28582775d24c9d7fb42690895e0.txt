Sweepstakes casinos are becoming increasingly popular in the United States as they offer players a low-risk alternative to traditional online casino games. These apps allow players to play for free and even win prizes. In this article, we will take a look at the three best sweepstakes casino apps in the US, namely Stake.us, Fortune Coins, and Pulsz.com.

Sweepstakes casinos operate differently from traditional online gambling sites and are therefore legal in practically all US states. Players use virtual currency to play games, meaning they cannot bet and win real money directly. However, players can still win real money prizes through sweepstakes prizes. Players use Sweeps Coins to play games in promotional mode and use their winnings to redeem real cash prizes.

There are three different virtual currencies in sweepstakes casinos that players need to be aware of: Gold Coins, Sweeps Coins, and Real Money.

Gold Coins are the primary virtual currency used to play standard games at a sweepstakes casino. This currency has no real-world value and cannot be withdrawn or used for any purpose other than the sweepstakes casino app or website. It also cannot be used to redeem real-world prizes.

Sweeps Coins, on the other hand, allows players to play promotional games for the chance to win prizes. Once a player has a certain number of Sweeps Coins and has met the app’s conditions, they can use them to redeem prizes. Some sweepstakes casino apps offer gift cards or merchandise as sweepstakes prizes, while others offer cash prizes.

Real Money is used to make in-app purchases, mainly to buy packages of Gold Coins. Specially-marked packages come with a Sweeps Coins bonus. Many sweepstakes casinos also pay out real money as prizes.

Gold Coins can be bought in packages or collected for free through various bonuses, giveaways, and promotions. In contrast, Sweeps Coins cannot be purchased as sweepstakes operators in the US are not allowed to charge players to enter. However, some specially-marked packs of Gold Coins come with free Sweeps Coins as a bonus. Players can collect free Sweeps Coins through other bonuses and promotions.

Although players can purchase packages of Gold Coins, there is no obligation to do so. Players can continually play for free on a sweepstakes casino site. New players will receive thousands of Gold Coins when they first register their account, while many apps also offer a handful of free Sweeps Coins. Players can top up their balance every day with the daily reload bonus or through other bonuses and promotions.

While online casinos are regulated and licensed by state gaming authorities, sweepstakes casinos operate under a different legal framework. In this article, we will discuss some of the online casino requirements that do not apply at sweepstakes casinos.

Online casinos are required to verify the age of their players to ensure that they are above the legal age limit to gamble. This is typically 21 years old in most US states. Verification is done by requesting players to provide a valid government-issued ID and verifying it against their account details. Sweepstakes casinos, on the other hand, do not have the same age verification requirements. This is because sweepstakes casinos do not involve real money gambling, and the prizes won are not considered to be gambling winnings.

Online casinos are required to verify a player’s location within the state where the casino is licensed. This is to ensure that players are not playing from outside the state’s jurisdiction where online gambling is not legal. Sweepstakes casinos do not have geolocation verification requirements as they are not bound by the same licensing requirements as online casinos.

Online casinos offer a variety of payment and withdrawal options for their players. These options include credit and debit cards, e-wallets, and bank transfers. Sweepstakes casinos, on the other hand, have more limited payment and withdrawal options. This is because sweepstakes casinos use virtual currency for gameplay, which cannot be withdrawn or used for any purpose outside the casino app or website. Additionally, sweepstakes casinos use separate virtual currencies for standard gameplay and promotional play, which may have different redemption requirements.

Online casinos are required to comply with state regulations regarding fair play, responsible gambling, and player protection. Sweepstakes casinos are not subject to the same regulatory requirements, although reputable sweepstakes casinos voluntarily comply with responsible gaming and player protection measures. Sweepstakes casinos also use third-party auditors to ensure fair play and transparency in gameplay.
