Itâ€™s been less than a week since Tennessee Republicans expelled Democratic Representatives Justin Jones and Justin Pearson from the House. The Nashville Metro Council reappointed Jones on Monday, having the Democrat miss not even a moment of House business. And now, two days later, the Shelby County Commission has voted to send Pearson back along with him.

On Wednesday, the Shelby County Commission voted 7-0 to send Pearson back to represent the constituents who already elected him. The 13-member commission is made up of 9 Democrats and 4 Republicans; only 7 members were present for the vote, all Democrats.
