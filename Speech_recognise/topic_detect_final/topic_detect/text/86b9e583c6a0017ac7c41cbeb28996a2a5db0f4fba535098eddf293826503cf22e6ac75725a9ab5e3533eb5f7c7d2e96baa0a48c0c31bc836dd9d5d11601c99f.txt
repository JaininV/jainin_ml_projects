Both lawmakers and pro athletes alike are speaking out to support trans kids seeking to compete in school sports.

On Tuesday, 14 trans and nonbinary lawmakers across the U. S. sent an open letter to President Joe Biden regarding a recently proposed rule change to Title IX. The proposal, which was announced by the Department of Education on April 6, attempts to strike a middle ground between trans athletes and those who oppose their existence. The proposed rule would still maintain that blanket bans on trans athletes are unconstitutional, but allows schools to develop individual policies that could ban trans athletes in the name of “fairness in competition.”

Tuesday’s letter, shared to Twitter by Montana House Rep. Zooey Zephyr, states that each lawmaker has seen “an extreme uptick in attempts to legalize hatred, exclusion, and discrimination.”

The lawmakers note that over 450 anti-trans bills have been introduced across the country in 2023, with 20 states passing sports bans that often target “a mere handful of trans athletes in their respective states.”

“While we understand the administration may have been attempting to provide legal protections & clarity, in actuality these proposed rule changes will simply provide those who seek to deny us our rights a roadmap for how to do so,” the letter reads. “To put it plainly, there is no such thing as an acceptable ‘compromise’ that limits transgender Americans’ access to equal rights.”
