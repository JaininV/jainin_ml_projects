Geotechnical site investigations will be conducted on the Codling Wind Park project site off the coast of Co Wicklow from early next month.

Project works will commence on Monday 8 May and continue through to late July, subject to weather and operational constraints.

The Codling Wind Park is an offshore wind energy project on the Codling Bank some 13km off the East Coast of Ireland. The geotechnical investigation (including boreholes and cone penetration tests) is intended to take place at 15 different locations within the project work site.

Operations will be conducted by the Dutch Pearl (callsign PBZP), a support vessel/tug, and the Excalibur (callsign YJKQ5), a jack-up barge, both of which are engaged in site investigations at the Kish and Bray banks this month.

The Excalibur will be positioned at each of the investigation points for several days which may extend in the event of inclement weather. The Dutch Pearl will be assisting the Excalibur in its daily operations and towing the barge between investigation points. The standby tug will be at anchor on the project site and will be conducting transits between the site and Dublin Port.

Both vessels will display the relevant light and shapes as required under COLREGS. Both vessels will keep continuous watch on VHF Channels 16 and 72. During operations, the vessels will be restricted in their ability to manoeuvre. All other vessels are requested to leave a wide berth during the operations.

Contact details, a map and coordinates of the survey area can be found in Marine Notice No 28 of 2023, attached below.
