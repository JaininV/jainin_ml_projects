The Tim Armstrong-led punk group Rancid has revealed their first album since 2017 on Tuesday, April 18. The title tune, “Tomorrow Never Comes,” from the forthcoming album, which is due out on June 2, was also released at the same time.

Are you prepared for Rancid’s first album since Trouble Maker?

Tomorrow Never Comes is produced by Brett Gurewitz, the Epitaph Records founder and longtime Rancid collaborator who also plays guitar in Bad Religion. Tomorrow Never Comes arrives this summer via Epitaph and Armstrong’s own Hellcat Records.
