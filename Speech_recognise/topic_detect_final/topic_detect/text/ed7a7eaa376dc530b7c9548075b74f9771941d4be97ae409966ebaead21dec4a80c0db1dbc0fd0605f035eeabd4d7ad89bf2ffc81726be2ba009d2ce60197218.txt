If you're stationed at  Joint Base Lewis-McChord and looking for a way to get involved in the local community, consider joining the Tacoma Mountaineers. The Mountaineers are a nonprofit organization dedicated to outdoor education and conservation, and they offer a wide variety of activities and events for members of all skill levels. The Tacoma Branch is the second oldest branch within the organization and they're a very active community.

Joining the Mountaineers is a great way to meet new people, learn new skills, and explore the beautiful natural areas around Tacoma and the Pacific Northwest. Here are some of the ways you can get involved with the Tacoma Mountaineers while stationed at JBLM.

The Tacoma Mountaineers have a number of committees that are responsible for organizing events and activities. These committees include the hiking committee, the climbing committee, the backpacking committee, and more. Joining a committee is a great way to get involved in the organization and help plan events that interest you.

The Mountaineers offer a variety of courses that cover everything from basic hiking and camping skills to advanced mountaineering and rock climbing. As a member, you can take courses at a discounted rate, and many courses are taught by experienced instructors who are also members of the organization.

The Mountaineers host a variety of events throughout the year, including hikes, backpacking trips, rock climbing outings, and more. These events are a great way to meet other members and explore the outdoors. The Mountaineers also host social events, such as potlucks and happy hours, where you can get to know other members in a more relaxed setting.

The Tacoma Mountaineers are always looking for volunteers to help with events and activities. Volunteering is a great way to get involved in the organization, meet new people, and give back to the community. You can volunteer to help with events, assist with courses, or even serve on a committee.

If you are interested in rock climbing, the Tacoma Mountaineers have a climbing committee that organizes outings and provides instruction for members of all skill levels. The Mountaineers also have a climbing gym in Tacoma that is open to members and non-members.

One of the best things about the Tacoma Mountaineers is the opportunity to explore the outdoors. As a member, you can join organized hikes and backpacking trips, or you can venture out on your own. The Mountaineers also offer courses in wilderness navigation and other skills to help you explore the outdoors safely and confidently.
