All ARMYs know very well that Hobi is going to join the army.  The celebrity literally has only a few days left on the “citizen”, but even during a busy time he does not forget about his fans and continues to delight them with content.  A real sensation was made by a photo of J-Hope on Weverse with a shaved head, where the guy showed what he would look like during the service.

“I will return healthy and unscathed!!”  — he left the inscription on the social network.  The post touched fans of the bias.  Readers of his blog got the feeling that Hoseok is already sitting on his suitcases and ready to join the military unit right now.  Why does he leave such touching words in advance?

Moreover, in a series of shots with a shaved head, J-Hope does not look alike at all.  He really looks like an ordinary person, but getting to know the famous K-pop star is not as easy as before.  “The yard boy”, “Ahahaha I watched him for a long time and thought how lucky this guy is, he kinda looks like J-Hope…uhhhh LITTLE karl”, users write, noting that Hoseok has become much younger with a new hairstyle and has started to look like 18 – an old boy who has just started his life.
