Steelers legend and Hall of Famer Jerome Bettis agreed 100% with Colin Cowherd that Mike Tomlin deserves fair criticism for making mistakes and missing on the offensive side of the ball. “Ninety percent of the NFL the strength of your football team is going to be your offense,” Bettis said. “We look at this team and they’ve got the pieces to be special. They’ve got a great tight end, they got two wide receivers, they got a running back, a quarterback. … The question mark is what type of offense are we and it’s been a question mark for the last three years.”

While he wants to see more points from the offense, Bettis was impressed with what Pickett showcased in Year 1. “I like him because we saw in the last four weeks of the season his development and he started to go out and win football games,” Bettis said. “That’s a hard thing to do in the NFL for a young quarterback to go out on the last drive of the game and drive your team down the field to a winning touchdown or field goal and he did it four times at the end of the year. You got to be special to do that.”
