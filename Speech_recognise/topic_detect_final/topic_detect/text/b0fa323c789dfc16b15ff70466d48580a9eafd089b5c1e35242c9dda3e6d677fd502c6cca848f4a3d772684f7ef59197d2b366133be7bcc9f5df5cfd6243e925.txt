Lately there has been a lot of talk about peer-to-peer markets in both the Lightning and Nostr ecosystems. There are at least a handful of projects that have launched or are working towards a launch, including:

As well as a few Bitcoin-specific marketplaces:

Since it's the weekend and there isn't much "news" to discuss, we thought it would be fun to have a roundtable discussion about the state of these peer-to-peer markets, and the things that need to be built to help them achieve their visions.

First, if we're missing any marketplace projects please post them in the comments.

Below is a list of thought-starter questions to get the ball rolling, but feel free to jump in with any questions or ideas you have:

* Which marketplaces appear to be the most robust/resilient to censorship?

* Which markets would you like to see these marketplaces serve first?

* What products or services should not be traded in a peer-to-peer market?

* Will marketplaces without topic-based or geographical limits be more difficult to scale up?

* Are there any technical or design choices that marketplaces are making which concern you?
