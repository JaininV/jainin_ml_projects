If you have a project in need of a Gen 3 HEMI, and the fit is going to be tight, then these are the manifolds for you. There are a lot of Mopar engines that were pretty tight in the engine compartments from the factory, so it should come as no surprise that a Gen 3 HEMI might also be a tight fit in some of them. Thankfully, the guys at Hooker have figured out the solution for all of you in that spot and have come out with a tight clearance fix with these new low-profile exhaust manifolds. There is more info below and the video really shows them off. Check them out.

Hooker BlackHeart’s low-profile exhaust manifolds are a perfect fit for Gen III Hemi engine swaps where durability, quiet operation, and a leak-free seal are desired. Our low-profile exhaust manifolds are designed to fit a wide range of swap applications where clearances are limited. When used with Holley Gen III engine swap components our exhaust manifolds are confirmed to fit on several popular Mopar platforms including: 1. 1967-1972 A-Body – Manual steering only (requires power steering or shortened steering column tube and u-joint style coupler) 2. 1966-1972 B-Body – Manual or Power Steering 3. 1970-1974 E-Body – Manual or Power Steering 4. 1987-1996 Dodge Dakota 2wd V6/V8 5. 1997-2004 Dodge Dakota 2wd V6/V8 (upper control arm clearance is recommended) 6. 1972-1993 Dodge D100/D150
