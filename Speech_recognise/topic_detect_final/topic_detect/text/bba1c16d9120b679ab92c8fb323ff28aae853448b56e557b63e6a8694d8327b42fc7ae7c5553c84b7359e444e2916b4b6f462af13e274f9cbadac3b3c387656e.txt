Illegal Canadian weed seized in U. S. up 900% since legalization

A new federal report says U. S. seizures of illegal pot from Canada has increased by at least 900% since Ottawa legalized cannabis, according to Blacklock’s Reporter.

A Department of Health study says cross-border bootlegging represents a “potential harm to Canada’s international reputation.”

“The quantity of cannabis seized on import at U. S. ports of entry that share a border with Canada has increased by at least 929% since domestic legalization.”

The report, called Horizontal Evaluation Of The Legalization And Strict Regulation Of Cannabis, added: “Experts who participated in the evaluation estimate the overall increase of illegal cannabis exportation from Canada worldwide since domestic legalization could be as high as 2,000%.”
