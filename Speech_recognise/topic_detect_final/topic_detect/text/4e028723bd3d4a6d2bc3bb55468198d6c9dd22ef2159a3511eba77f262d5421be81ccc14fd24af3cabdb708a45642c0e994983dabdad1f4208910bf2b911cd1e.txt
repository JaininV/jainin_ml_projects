I have been thinking about this in depth, specifically about the incentives involved (only wrt Commercial Open Source Software, with an Open Core).For developers, the obvious incentive is to learn, practice, network and grow in the industry. For organisations, it helps get more eyeballs on what is being built, if positioned for the right audience, while also improving the quality of code. The question in my mind though, is about how quality of code can be improved with the best talent contributing, while also incentivising the talent to contribute. A few companies in this space have come up with the concept of paid OSS bounties, but the quotes and rates being offered there are notoriously low. This obviously means that the best talent wouldn't be interested. So, how can the BEST developers be incentivised to contribute, so that companies can benefit, while also ensuring that nobody is left unhappy in this equation?
