What raises a person's risk of suffering Urinary Tract Infection, what health complications can it cause and how long does it take for a patient to recover completely from this disease? Let's understand the disease in detail.

Urinary Tract Infection, also known as UTI is a condition that occurs when there is an infection in any part of the urinary system. Our urinary system includes the kidneys, ureters, bladder and urethra. Most infections involve the lower urinary tract     the bladder and the urethra. This means a UTI could signal that there is an infection in any of these organs and it should be managed immediately.

How dangerous can the infection turn if proper care is not given on time? If an infection is limited to the bladder, it can be painful and cause discomfort in carrying out everyday work. It can majorly affect the usual functioning of the body. But if the condition is serious, then certain health problems can result if a UTI spreads to the kidneys.
