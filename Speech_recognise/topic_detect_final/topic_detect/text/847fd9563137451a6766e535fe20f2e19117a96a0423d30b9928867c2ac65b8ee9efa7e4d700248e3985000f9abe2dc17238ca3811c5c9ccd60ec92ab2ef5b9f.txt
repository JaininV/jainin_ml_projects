Maybe it was lazy writing, maybe there was no other choice. But it's safe to say that none of these fictional characters deserved their fate. Thanks to a Twitter prompt posted by user Michael Matteo Rossi, we've compiled 10 of the most gut-wrenching character endings to ever hit the silver screen.

Unfortunately if you're friends with Sidney Prescott, you die.

Gaston truly just wants to marry and care for Belle, until a furry man-beast decides to kidnap her. But sure, he deserved to die *sarcasm.*

Dobby does everything he can to protect Harry, and ends up getting stabbed by a thrown knife. WTF?

Just one of the multiple times I cried during this film. Thanos really is one of the worst fictional villains ever.

Talk about traumatizing children's movies. Spoiler Alert: He can't see without his glasses!

Although Mufasa definitely did not deserve to be thrown off a cliff into a stampede by his brother, this tragedy awakens the King inside of Simba so there's that.

Imagine surviving not one, but two hunger games, marrying the woman of your dreams, only to go ahead and die in a sewer. Absolute garbage.

Not even a main character, Zara just happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Perhaps the most horrific death of the entire series.

This is a kid's movie! What are we doing here?! Break out the tissues.

Last but certainly not least. Gone but never forgotten. G-Baby dies as a result of stray bullets during a drive-by. This one hurts. Rest in peace, young king.
