On that note, style setters are teaming their leggings with a range of spring trends, but a few key items seem to be favorites among the fashion crowd. Below you’ll discover five items that look effortlessly chic with basic leggings. If you want to add something fresh to your wardrobe, you’ll also find inspired shopping recommendations (including leggings) throughout.
