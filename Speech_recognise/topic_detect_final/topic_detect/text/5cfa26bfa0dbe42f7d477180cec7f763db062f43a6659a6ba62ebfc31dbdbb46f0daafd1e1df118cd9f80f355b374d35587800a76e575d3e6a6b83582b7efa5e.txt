A MAN has captured the moment that his neighbour ordered him to move from his own parking space.

The footage was uploaded to TikTok by user @tylerdilisio and has been liked more than 10million times already.

The video begins with Tyler sitting in his truck outside where he lives, parked up next to a line of other cars.

He turns the camera to face the driver's window as a woman appears - appearing to know that she isn't happy.

The video is captioned: 'Got home from work, parked in my paid spot and gotta deal with this s*** #karen.'

As Tyler winds down the window the woman immediately says: "I got your plate! You're going to be in real trouble.

"You're sitting in the car and I need to park here."

Tyler responds: "No I'm parking here, I live here."

The woman then says: "Well get out, you don't have a car pass."

"I do, and it's not your business, I live here" returns the truck driver.

The woman then says: "You're here a lot and I see you - you don't live here. And even so, I need to park here."

After Tyler points out that's not how it works the woman says: "You are a disgusting piece of cr*p."

"Your mother," returns the man, before the woman hits his window and walks off.

People in the comments were mostly on Tyler's side.

One said: "There has never been and there never will be a more perfect and appropriate response to a Karen! Ya mutha!"

Another said: "Finally somebody who not just letting ppl or Karen’s talk to them any kind of way… I approve this video."

While a third pointed out: "I see you a lot - I mean that’s usually what happens when you live in the same area as someone else."
