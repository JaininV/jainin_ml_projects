Angel Olsen has definitely peaked our interest with her new EP Forever Means. Out Friday April 14 the EP should have plenty of energy and strife wrapped within it. Olsen admits the song is a sort of nod to George Harrison, and her voice is big and triumphant throughout. Stream it below before preordering her new EP from Jagjaguwar.

The song opens with heavy vocals and lyrics that will melt your heart. Her smiling face reciting the lyrics really shimmers. Her honesty is exactly what you want. The smaller words and lyrics sound deep and gut wrenching.  The way she lets out a ramble of words takes your breath away while educating you at the same time. It’s remarkable.

The song can be heard above or wherever you stream music. Forever Means EP is available for preorder from Jagajguwar Records. Angel Olsen is on tour starting April 16 at High Water Festival in North Charleston, SC until December 09 at Haw River Ballroom in Saxpahaw, NC. Her tour dates can be found here.
