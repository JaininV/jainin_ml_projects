Senator George Thompson Sekibo of the South East Senatorial District of the state has been placed on administrative leave by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Ward 2 of the Ogu/Bolo Local Government Area of Rivers due to alleged anti-party activities.

The suspension was announced in a statement on Sunday, according to reports from PDP Ward 2 Ogu-Bolo LGA Chairman Alatoru Sydney and Council Secretary Joshua Tamuno.

Sekibo, a supporter of Atiku Abubakar, the PDP’s presidential candidate, was listed in the statement as having been expelled from the party, along with Sunny Asetubobe, Eugene Enos, Navy Capt. Victor Erasmus, and Gilbert Enos and Erasmus.

It was further stated that the decision to suspend the PDP leaders was made during an executive meeting where a review of the most recent elections for the president, the national assembly, the governorship, and the state house of assembly was conducted.

The statement reads, “It was observed with dismay that the anti-party activities of the suspended party stalwarts of Ward 2 of Ogu/Bolo Local Government Area as they worked against the PDP.

The PDP Ward 2 Executive discovered that the aforementioned suspended members of the party had neglected to pay their annual subscription fees as required by section 8 subsection 9 of the PDP constitution 2017 as amended, leading to the vote of no confidence and suspension.

Likewise, the PDP Executive of Ward 10 Ogu/Bolo Local Government Area passed a vote of no confidence and suspended Navy Capt. Victor Erasmus, Hon. Gilbert Enos, and Eugene Enos from the PDP for the same reasons as the aforementioned party stalwarts from Ward 2, namely anti-party activities and failure to pay the annual subscription fee.
