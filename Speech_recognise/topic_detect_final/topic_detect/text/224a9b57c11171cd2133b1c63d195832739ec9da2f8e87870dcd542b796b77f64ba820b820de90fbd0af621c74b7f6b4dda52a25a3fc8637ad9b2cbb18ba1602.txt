New In-Store and Online Resources and Experiences Available for Parents and Gift Givers

,  /PRNewswire/ — (NASDAQ: BBBY) buybuy BABY, America’s leading specialty baby products omnichannel retailer, today announced enhancements to its customer-loved Registry experience, including educational and interactive events that help welcome registrants to parenthood.

“We know each customer is on a unique parenting journey, so one size does not fit all when it comes to creating a baby registry. We’re listening to what our customers want and expanding our Registry offerings, like the addition of cash funds, to provide even more options and flexibility,” said Patty Wu, Executive Vice President and Brand President, buybuy BABY. “Our experience helping millions of parents over the last 25 years has helped shape our redesigned Registry experience and we’re proud to be a trusted source for parents as they get ready for this exciting new chapter.”

New Registry Features and Benefits

New Registry features and benefits include cash funds, which allow parents to receive money toward services or experiences such as doulas, food delivery, postpartum care, and more. Additionally, registrants will receive $150 in rewards and free shipping for one year when $1,500 worth of product is fulfilled from their registry. buybuy BABY has also revamped its Registry Welcome Box, which includes deluxe samples, coupons, and monthly milestone cards for baby’s first year.
