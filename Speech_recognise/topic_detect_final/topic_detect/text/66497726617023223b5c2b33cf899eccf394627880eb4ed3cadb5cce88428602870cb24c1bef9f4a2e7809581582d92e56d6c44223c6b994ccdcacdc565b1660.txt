MenuHow I Can Help

April is Abortion Recovery Awareness Month and this week I’m sharing stories of those who by the grace of Jesus have recovered.  Lisa Stribling was seventeen, mother of a toddler and homeless when she had her first abortion.  Her life was dark and drug infested.  A year later abortion number two.  Then, another pregnancy but she married her boyfriend.  Soon, another pregnancy and her third abortion, but they were taking a toll.  Her husband, now in jail, became a Christian.  Lisa was seven months pregnant and also in jail.  The babies were conjoined so she had her fourth abortion, five dead babies.  In jail Lisa became a Christian.  Only Jesus can clean up a mess like this and He did.  The couple now pastor a church, a living testament to God’s mercy.
