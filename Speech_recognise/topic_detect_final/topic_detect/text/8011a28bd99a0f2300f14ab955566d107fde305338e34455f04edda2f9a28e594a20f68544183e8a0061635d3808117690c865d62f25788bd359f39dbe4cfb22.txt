Last year, California passed AB 587, which requires social media companies to give reports to California's AG on topics such as misinformation, disinformation, extremism, and hate speech.

California is requiring social media companies to give these reports to the state Attorney General or be fined.

Seth explains why this is a big deal:

They're claiming it's just about "transparency." That's not true. This is a censorship bill, not a transparency bill. Here's Gavin Newsom himself explaining why he signed the bill into law: "California will not stand by as social media is weaponized to spread hate and disinformation that threaten our communities and foundational values as a country."

This is an obvious ploy to censor speech by California. Democrats like Newsom think that it's "misinformation" and "hate speech" to call Rachel Levine a man. They aren't interested in security or stopping actual terror. It's about policing your speech and your ability to speak the truth.

So The Bee is stepping up and suing California's AG.

In short, we argue that the law violates the First Amendment, is too vague to be constitutionally enforced, and violates the free speech guarantees in the California Constitution. You can read the full complaint here.

Online commentator Tim Pool is also joining the Babylon Bee in this lawsuit in hopes that a federal district court will block California's unconstitutional attempt to censor speech.
