We recently heard about the changes Michigan is making to its pure Michigan slogan, which is now being refreshed with the slogan "Keep it Fresh." In the spirit of keeping it fresh, I wondered what it would look like if Michigan decided to change up another iconic icon, which is its flag.

There is currently a proposal out that could give a facelift to Michigan’s flag, which is been in circulation since 1911. This is something that was brought up back in 2016 but never led to any changes. There are a lot of opportunities when you’re considering making a new flag design. What really encapsulates everything that Michigan is about? There are so many things we're known for, how can you shrink it all down to just one flag?

Well, we have some staples that stand out, and not to toot my own horn, but I think I came up with some really refreshing and fun ideas that perfectly represent the state. Below is a small gallery of flag ideas that I had that I personally think would fit the state really well. Of course, I came up with a super early in the morning and not everybody is a goofball like me.

Nevertheless, enjoy these flag designs and leave me some feedback on what kind of flag you would like to see replace our current flag, if at all. I know a lot of people are perfectly fine with the way the flag is now, but it never hurts to throw in an alternative idea every once in a while.
