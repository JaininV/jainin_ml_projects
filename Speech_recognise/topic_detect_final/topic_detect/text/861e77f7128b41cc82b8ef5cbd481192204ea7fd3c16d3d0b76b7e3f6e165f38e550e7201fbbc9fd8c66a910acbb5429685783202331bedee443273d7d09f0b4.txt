Nick and Vanessa Lachey—the imperfect cohosts of Netflix's hit dating show Love Is Blind—have once again come under fire for “being bad at their jobs,” among other complaints. The current backlash stems from Sunday night's disastrous season 4 reunion, which was delayed by more than an hour due to technical difficulties. But the disappointments didn't end there. After the episode aired, scores of angry viewers took to social media to express their unhappiness with Vanessa's behavior (and Nick's bemused silence) on the episode.

Specifically, Vanessa is being called out for interrupting and cutting contestants off, taking sides, projecting her personal experiences onto the lives of contestants, treating male cast members unfairly, and posing invasive questions about when or if married contestants plan to have children.

After a particularly hostile on-air exchange about his breakup with fellow contestant Micah Lussier, cast member Paul Peden told Entertainment Tonight that it felt like Vanessa had a “personal bias” against him.

“I was like, ‘Fuck man.’ They kept drilling, drilling it down on me,” Peden told ET. “I think I said my piece. I think Vanessa might have had a little bit of personal bias in that scenario or at least I kind of detected that. I don’t know. But that’s just my assumption based on how she continued to drill into it after I gave my full rationale for why I felt the way that I did.”
