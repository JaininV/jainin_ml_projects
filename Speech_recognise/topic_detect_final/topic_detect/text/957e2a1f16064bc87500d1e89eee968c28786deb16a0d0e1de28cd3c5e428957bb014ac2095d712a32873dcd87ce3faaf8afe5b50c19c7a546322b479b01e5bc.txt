My guest today made wild horses accessible to people with her stories of the stallion, Cloud. She showed that wild horses have society, friendships, relationships, personalities, and they have lives that you can follow and get to know. This made a huge difference in the public perception of wild horses, and her documentation of the Pryor Mountain Herd has led us into the world of wild horses.

Ginger Kathrens is an Emmy Award-winning producer, cinematographer, writer,  editor, as well as an award-winning author. She introduced Cloud, Wild Stallion of the Rockies, to the world in her famous documentaries, giving us the first in-depth look at the rich and complex society of wild horses. Ginger is the founder of The Cloud Foundation and acts as the foundation’s Board President.
