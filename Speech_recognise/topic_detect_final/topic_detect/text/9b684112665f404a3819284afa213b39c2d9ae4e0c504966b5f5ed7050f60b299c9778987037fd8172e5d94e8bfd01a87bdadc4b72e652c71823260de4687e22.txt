The UN was forced to make what they called “an appalling choice” after telling all of their workers in Afghanistan to stay away from their offices in that nation. This follows the Taliban’s prohibition against female employees working with that organization.

Representatives from the United Nations released the following statement:

“UN national personnel – women and men – have been instructed not to report to UN offices, with only limited and calibrated exceptions made for critical tasks.���

Several female UN employees in Afghanistan have already been facing harassment and, sometimes, detention since the Taliban’s hostile takeover of that nation in 2021.
