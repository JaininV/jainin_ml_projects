After 20 years of publishing The Real Deal, it can sometimes feel like we’ve seen everything in New York real estate.

But 2023 is proving once again that this industry is endlessly unpredictable and fascinating. From office distress and development deadlines to New York politics and brokerage turmoil, there’s a lot to discuss about real estate’s present and future.

That’s why we’re excited to be back at the Metropolitan Pavilion on May 4, bringing some of the industry’s biggest names to the stage to make sense of it all at TRD’s annual NYC Real Estate Forum.

The doors open at 10 a.m. and programming kicks off at 11 with a discussion about this year’s most-feared topic: the office market. Silverstein Properties CEO Marty Burger and Metro Loft founding principal Nathan Berman will explain how the savviest office owners are surviving and even thriving in this relentless economic cycle.

Then we’ll bring in the brokerage experts. In a market with some hot spots and some pain points — mortgage rates, anyone? — we’ll take a look at a few residential brokerage strategies that are separating the wheat from the chaff. A major one: the mega-team. John Gomes from the famed Eklund-Gomes team and the inimitable luxury broker Nikki Field will appear at noon to share their secrets of resi dominance.

At 1 p.m. we’ll be joined by industry titan Scott Rechler, who made waves this year by writing off a few buildings of RXR’s massive portfolio as obsolete — “Kodak,” as he put it, in a digital world.

Later, we’ll hear from experts at the intersection of real estate and politics. In a city as complicated as New York, hearing from uber-lobbyist Suri Kasirer, City Planning Commission chair Dan Garodnick and land use attorney (and former City Council member) Ken Fisher could be the difference between getting a project through and watching it die. They’ll speak at 3 p.m.

There’s even more to be announced. Keep watching this space, but make sure to get your tickets today.
