It’s official – PowerWash Simulator has made the record books! Specifically, Guinness World Records has awarded streamer and comedian Ellie Gibson the world record for longest videogame marathon playing PowerWash Simulator after her 24 hour charity stream in February.

Ellie Gibson, one half of the comedy duo Scummy Mummies, completed a 24 hour Twitch stream playing PowerWash Simulator on February 28, 2023 to raise money for the London-based charity Borne. The organisation works to research the causes of premature birth and prevent the associated health complications.

After her successful record attempt in February, Gibson finally has her hands on the official Guinness World Record certificate for the longest videogame marathon playing PowerWash Simulator. On Twitter she said, “Some might say that’s 24 hours and six minutes I’ll never get back. I say, have YOU got a certificate in a frame that says YOU’RE a record breaker? HAVE YOU?”

She also gave shout-outs to her Twitch mods and all of her special guests, including Dara O’Briain, Ed Byrne, and Thanyia Moore. The official PowerWash Simulator Twitter account also sent her congratulations on her achievement.
