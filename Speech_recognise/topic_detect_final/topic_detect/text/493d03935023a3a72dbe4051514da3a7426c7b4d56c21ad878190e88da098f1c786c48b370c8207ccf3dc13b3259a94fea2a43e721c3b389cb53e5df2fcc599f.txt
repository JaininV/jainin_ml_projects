There I was in 2012 watching The Voice when the unthinkable happened. Contestant Amanda Brown sang a rousing rendition of the Grace Potter and the Nocturnals song “Stars,” and judge Christina Aguilera didn’t recognize the song! Given the sheer volume of music out there, it’s understandable, but I was scandalized. Some part of me believed, deeply, that a talent like Grace Potter must be known to other musicians of immense talent. On The Lion the Beast the Beat (Hollywood, 2012), the band moved to a bigger and more experimental sound compared to the stripped yet delicious rock of its self-titled release. The lack of a core sound leaves the album without a striking identity and easy to neglect as the years pass, but the ballad “Stars” is unforgettable. Check out every version you can:
