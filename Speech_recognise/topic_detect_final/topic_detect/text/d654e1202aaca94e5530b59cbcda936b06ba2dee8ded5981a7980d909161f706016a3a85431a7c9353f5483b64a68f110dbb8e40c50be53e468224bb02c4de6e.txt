RUSKIN, FL - Madison Communities, a multifamily subsidiary of Madison Capital Group, announced today that construction has begun on Madison Palms, a 317-unit community in Ruskin, Florida. Ryan Hanks, CEO of Madison Capital Group, made the announcement.

The new community, located at 210 Teco Road, will serve Hillsborough County, one of the fastest growing counties in Florida. Madison Palms’ 300,000 square feet of rentable space will be divided among one, two and three bedroom units ranging from 719 square feet to 1,403 square feet.

“We’re excited to bring our vision for garden-style apartment communities planned with thoughtful amenities and luxury design to the Tampa market,” said Ryan Hanks, CEO of Madison Capital Group. “Madison Palms will be carefully woven into the fabric of the Ruskin community to ensure that its residents will have everything they need to thrive in their new homes.”

Future residents will enjoy amenities designed to support their lifestyles, including luxury unit finishes, an integrated clubhouse with a fitness center, and an outdoor lounge with a summer kitchen. Madison Palms will also offer a resort-style pool and pool deck with grilling stations, recreation areas and cabanas.

The property will benefit from its proximity to a high-growth corridor along I-75, East College Avenue and Sun City Center Boulevard. Madison Palms’s ideal location allows easy access to many amenities and employers, including Sun City Center, a master-planned senior community with over 25,000 residents, an Amazon fulfillment center that employs more than 1,000 people and two premier shopping centers.
