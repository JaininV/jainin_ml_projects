North Dakota on Tuesday night became the latest state to bar transgender girls and women from joining female sports teams, starting from kindergarten and all the way through college.

The new restrictions in North Dakota, which were signed by Gov. Doug Burgum, a Republican, came less than a week after the Biden administration weighed in on the charged debate over transgender athletes. Under the administration’s proposed rule change, schools would be allowed to block some transgender athletes from competing on sports teams that match their gender identities, but would be prevented from enacting across-the-board bans.

North Dakota’s laws and others like it could be headed for a clash with federal regulation if and when Mr. Biden’s proposed change takes effect. According to legal experts the federal instruction would override state laws.

When asked about laws like North Dakota’s, the federal Department of Education cautioned that its rule change was still a proposal and subject to public comment. But it stressed that “all federally funded education programs and activities must comply with Title IX and the Department’s regulations implementing Title IX.”
