Team USA dominated Czechia in its 9-1 semifinal win Saturday to advance to the IIHF Women’s World Championship gold medal game. Here’s what you need to know:

* The Americans exploded in the second period by scoring five goals, including two from captain Hilary Knight.

* Amanda Kessel scored the first goal of the game in the first period and added another in the second.

* The U.S. will play the winner of Canada versus Switzerland, the second semifinal game Saturday.

* This year’s gold medal game could potentially be a rematch of last year’s final, where Canada defeated Team USA 2-1 in Herning, Denmark.

Team USA beat Japan, Switzerland and Czechia in the preliminary round of the tournament. The American’s 6-2 win over Czechia moved them above Canada into the top spot of the Group A standings. However, Canada retook the lead in the group standings after Canada held off USA in the ninth round of a shootout to win the preliminary thriller.

In the quarterfinals, USA beat Germany 3-0 with goals from Kessel, Hannah Bilka and Abbey Murphy.
