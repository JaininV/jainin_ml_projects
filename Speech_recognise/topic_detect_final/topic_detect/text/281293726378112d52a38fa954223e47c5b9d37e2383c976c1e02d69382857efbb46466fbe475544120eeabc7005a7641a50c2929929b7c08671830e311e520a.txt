Chillax is a free geometric font that is perfect for use in writing large titles on both websites and graphic designs. This font has a modernist style inspired by the 1920s, making it ideal for contemporary editorial projects, cultural and lifestyle apps. This font was designed in the Bauhaus style, where the lowercase letters follow a pattern established in 1926 by Herbert Bayer, and the uppercase letters were later added by Manushi Parikh.

Chillax is available in two formats: a family of six font weights or a single variable font file that allows you to choose from hundreds of different shades. In both formats, Chillax includes several alternative letterforms that can be used thanks to the OpenType features of the font. Hereâ€™s a preview of the included weights:
