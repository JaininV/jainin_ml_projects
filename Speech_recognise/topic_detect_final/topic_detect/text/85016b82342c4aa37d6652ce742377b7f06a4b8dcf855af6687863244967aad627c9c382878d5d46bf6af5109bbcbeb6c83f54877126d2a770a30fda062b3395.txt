The romance between Melinda "Mel" Monroe (Alexandra Breckenridge) and Jack Sheridan (Martin Henderson) is at the heart of "Virgin River," though this pairing has had to overcome plenty of challenges along the way. One of the biggest obstacles getting in the way of their relationship is Charmaine Robert (Lauren Hammersley), a woman that Jack is casually dating when he meets Mel. This love triangle gets even more complicated after Charmaine announces that she's expecting twins, and Jack is the father. Charmaine eventually admits that Jack isn't actually the father, and the identity of the twins' father is one of Season 4's biggest unanswered questions.

Even though Martin Henderson knows the father of Charmaine's twins, he's not spilling the beans. However, fans have a theory that police detective Mike Valenzuela (Marco Grazzini) is the father of Charmaine's babies. "I think Charmaine's babies are Mike's," wrote Reddit user u/Kabeyfw in a thread discussing predictions for Season 5. "Did you see the odd look flash on Mike's face when Jack told him she was pregnant and his response was like, oh, I didn't know y'all were still a thing? Not finished with Season 4 yet but it would explain why Mike sticks around and why he and his fianc√©e break up."

Mike's arrival in town doesn't exactly match up with the progression of Charmaine's pregnancy, but viewers still can't help but notice his reaction to the news. Jack and Mike are longtime friends, so that realization would certainly cause a lot of drama.
