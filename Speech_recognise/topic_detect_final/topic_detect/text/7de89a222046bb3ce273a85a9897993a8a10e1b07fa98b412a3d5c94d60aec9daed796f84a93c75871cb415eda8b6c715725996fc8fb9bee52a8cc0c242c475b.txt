SINGAPORE: Heavy traffic at both Woodlands and Tuas Checkpoints is expected during the upcoming Hari Raya Puasa weekend, said the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) on Tuesday (Apr 18).

With Hari Raya Puasa falling on Saturday, traffic is expected to be heavy from Thursday to next Monday. Travellers departing or entering by car or bus are advised to factor in additional time for immigration clearance.

ICA noted that traffic flow through both checkpoints has returned to pre-COVID levels during peak hours.

During the Hari Raya Puasa long weekend in 2018, more than 1.5 million travellers crossed the land checkpoints, averaging about 380,000 crossings per day.

Waiting time for travellers departing by car to clear Singapore's land checkpoints was up to three hours, said ICA, adding that motorists also faced continuous tailbacks from Malaysia's checkpoints.

This resulted in queues extending beyond the Seletar Expressway (SLE) for the Woodlands Checkpoint and along the Ayer Rajah Expressway (AYE) for the Tuas Checkpoint.

"ICA anticipates similar heavy traffic situation at both land checkpoints in the lead-up to and during the Hari Raya Puasa weekend," the authority said.

Motorists are advised to check the traffic situation at the land checkpoints through the Land Transport Authority (LTA)'s One Motoring website or the Expressway Monitoring & Advisory System installed along the Bukit Timah Expressway (BKE) and AYE.

They can also get updates through ICA's Facebook and Twitter accounts, as well as local radio broadcasts on Money 89.3, Kiss92, One 91.3, Hao 96.3 and UFM 100.3.

Singapore residents and eligible first-time foreign visitors travelling by bus are encouraged to use the automated lanes at the passenger halls to clear immigration.
