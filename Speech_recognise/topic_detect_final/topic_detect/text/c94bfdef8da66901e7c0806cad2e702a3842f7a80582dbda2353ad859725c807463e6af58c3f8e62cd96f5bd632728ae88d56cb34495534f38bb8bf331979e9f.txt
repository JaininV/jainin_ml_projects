A defense attorney for the YSL Rico trial didn’t turn off his street slang lingo while in court.

A video went viral of Justin Hill, one of the court-appointed defense attorneys for the case, telling the judge “It’s cap.” The conversation went like this,

Justin: “So, I will start by saying that this assertion that I did not mention before pre-argument.”

The judge interrupts: “Don’t worry about that. Because I’d have to do it anyway. So, don’t even worry about that, okay?” Then Justin uses the “cap” phrase,

Justin: “Okay. I was saying that it’s just not true. It’s cap, to be honest.”

The video cuts off after. The Jasmine Brand reports, “The comments appear to come from defense attorney Justin Hill, who said last week that he would be making more money working in fast food than on the trial.” Take a look:

The article says Justin is a court-appointed attorney for one of the 14 defendants facing trial in the YSL Rico Trial. “Justin is reportedly being paid $15,000 to represent his client at trial, regardless of how long that might take,” according to the report.

Thug, Gunna, and dozens of YSL members were arrested on RICO charges last year. The indictment claims Thug is the leader of a gang that terrorized Atlanta over the past decade.

Gunna struck a plea deal and was released, along with a few other members. However, Thug remains behind bars, awaiting trial. It was set to begin in January but had a few delays.
