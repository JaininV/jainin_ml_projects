A teenager in Indonesia stabbed his elder sibling to death in a fit of rage over a packet of instant noodles.

The incident took place in Lalan district, South Sumatra on April 8 when the 15-year-old bought a packet of instant noodles from a nearby shop to break fast.

Local police said the older sibling was angry when he found out that the teenager, identified with the initial AL, bought only one packet.

As a result, the 27-year-old older sibling, identified with the initial R, slapped AL and squeezed his cheeks in anger, said Lalan police chief Hasurungan Hutajulu on Monday.

“The alleged perpetrator, who was slicing onions and kangkung with a knife in the kitchen, spontaneously stabbed the victim in the stomach,” said Mr Hutajulu.

Family members immediately took the injured sibling to a nearby clinic, but the victim died shortly thereafter.

Police said they have seized the knife used in the incident. The teenager is currently being held at a police station.

Village head Karang Agung Aripin told Tribunnews the siblings were not known to have any problems, adding that the teenager was known to be a quiet child.
