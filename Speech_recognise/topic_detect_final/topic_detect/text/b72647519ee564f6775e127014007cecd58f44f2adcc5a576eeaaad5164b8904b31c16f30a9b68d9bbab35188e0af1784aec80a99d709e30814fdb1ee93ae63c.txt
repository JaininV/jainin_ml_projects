The police in Ogun has confirmed the arrest of a 33-year-old woman, for allegedly selling her 18-month-old baby for N600,000 in Sango-Ota area of the state.

This is contained in a statement in Sango-Ota on Monday, by SP Abimbola Oyeyemi, the Police Spokesman in the state.

“The police is yet to identify the suspected buyer. The suspect was arrested following a complaint lodged at the Sango Divisional Headquarters by the woman’s husband, Nureni Rasaq.

“Rasaq reported that his wife left home to Lagos on March 15, with their baby girl but returned home without the baby.

“He said that all efforts to know what happened to the baby failed because the woman was unable to give any reasonable account of the whereabouts of the baby,” the PPRO said.

Oyeyemi said that upon the complaint, the Divisional Police Officer, Sango Division, CSP Dahiru Saleh, detailed his detectives to go after the woman and she was promptly arrested.

He added that on interrogation, the suspect confessed that she sold the baby to someone in Lagos for N600, 000.

Oyeyemi said that when asked, why she sold her baby, the suspect said that she borrowed money from a microfinance bank and when she was unable to pay back the money, the bank agents started threatening to deal with her.

“She ran to Lagos and started hawking sachet water. It was while hawking that she met a man, who introduced her to the woman who eventually bought the child,” the PPRO said.

The Acting Commissioner of Police, DCP Babakura Muhammed, has directed that the suspect be transferred tothe  State Criminal Investigation Departments for further investigation and possible recovery of the baby.
