(Los Angeles, CA) â€” The bulk of the TV and film writers are getting closer to walking off the job. On Monday, members of the Writers Guild of America authorized a strike. That means the union leadership can call a strike if ongoing negotiations with the big Hollywood studios fall apart. Writers want better compensation for streaming shows. A strike 16 years ago over similar issues lasted 100 days and crippled much of the entertainment industry. The current WGA contract expires May first.
