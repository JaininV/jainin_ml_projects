Former Chelsea forward, Joe Cole has urged the club to sell at least ten of their players this summer.

This was in reaction to Chelsea's Champions League exit at the hands of Real Madrid.

Real Madrid defeated the Blues 2-0 at the Bernabeu last week and repeated the same margin at Stamford Bridge, thanks to Rodrygo's second-half brace.

Chelsea will have nothing to show for over six hundred million pound spent on players in the last two transfer windows while Real Madrid progress to the Champions League semi-finals, where they will face either Manchester City or Bayern Munich.

Stamford Bridge currently has over 30 first-team players and this, according to Cole, makes managing the team very difficult.

Reports have it that this was one of the reasons former Brighton boss Potter struggled at the club.

Chelsea will certainly not be in the Champions League, Europa League or even the Conference League next season and Cole believes it could be a blessing in disguise for the team.

"It [not playing in Europe] helped Antonio Conte's team. Chelsea finished 10th and then won the league after Conte came in.

"Without a doubt, it will help the team.

"But it will only help if Chelsea offload at least 10 players. I think at least 10 players need to be trimmed from the squad."
