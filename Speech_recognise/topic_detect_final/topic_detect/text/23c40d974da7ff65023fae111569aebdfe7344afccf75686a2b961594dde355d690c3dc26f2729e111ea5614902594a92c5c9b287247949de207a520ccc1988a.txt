Keefe told the media in Florida it was not his intention to get Knies in the lineup so fast, as he hasn’t practiced with the team or played since losing the final of Saturday’s NCAA Frozen Four to Quinnipiac in a 3-2 overtime heartbreaker. But an injury to forward Sam Lafferty at practice on Sunday and the ongoing absence of Calle Jarnkrok created a roster spot, with Toronto using a lineup of 11 forwards and seven defencemen against the Panthers.

“Great opportunity for him to get right in,” Keefe said before the game. “It hasn’t been ideal circumstances in terms of his travel and even with medicals and all these kind of things.  But ideal circumstances passed us by long ago so here we are.”

Keefe said Lafferty is likely out for tomorrow’s game against Tampa Bay as well as the three-game road trip continues. Jarnkrok did skate Monday morning in an optional workout.  Watching the Leafs’ lineup closely are the Panthers, who are trying to hold on to their wildcard playoff spot and the New York Islanders and Pittsburgh Penguins who are right behind and need the Leafs as close to their best as possible. Florida clinches a spot if it wins in regulation or overtime and the Islanders lose to Washington in regulation.    The Leafs boxed themselves into signing two goalies on amateur tryout contracts in consecutive games because of their desire to get Knies under contract to burn one of the three years on his entry level deal. The resulting salary cap squeeze led to the University of Toronto’s Jett Alexander backing up Saturday (and playing 70 seconds). But because the NHL suspected the Leafs weren’t up front about Matt Murray’s injury status on Saturday — the club claimed the plan was to have him back up when he wasn’t even practising — the league turned down the Leafs’ attempt to recall Joseph Woll from the Marlies, at least for the Panthers game.  It all resulted in the OHL Owen Sound Attack’s Nick Chenier signing an ATO Monday to play behind Samsonov.
