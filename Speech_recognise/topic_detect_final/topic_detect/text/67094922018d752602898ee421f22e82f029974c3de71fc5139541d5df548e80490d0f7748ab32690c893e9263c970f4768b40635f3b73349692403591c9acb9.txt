Do you remember Valentine’s Day in elementary school? Most of us can think back to the days prepping small candies, attaching individual cards, and exchanging them with our classmates – what fun it was!

Now imagine being right back there in that classroom…but this time no one gives you a card. You can see they are giving them to people around you, but not a single person thinks to include you. Can you imagine how lonely that would feel? 🙁

The sad reality is that loneliness is all too common, and especially in February for Valentine’s celebrations. That’s why we’d like to challenge you to make that one lost sheep feel seen and loved by their church (in February, must also year-round). Send a text with pictures to your church!

The Flocknote team has done the work to provide new ready-made graphics (with more being added each month!) so that you can surprise folks with a thoughtful SuperText that catches them at some point in their day and reminds them that your church is thinking of them. These graphics are available in English, Spanish, and French!

How does it work?A SuperText can be up to 480 characters OR includes an image OR both! To keep Flocknote church-budget friendly, we offer SuperTexting as an optional add-on feature available in credit packages that can be purchased, rolled over, and used when your church needs to. And guess what – the credits never expire!Rest assured, standard texts (texts without pictures and under 160 characters) are still unlimited and included as part of your monthly Flocknote pricing. View full pricing and learn how to send your first SuperText!

Keep sending timely images year round with Flocknote’s continually-updating Image Library! Have questions about Flocknote and using SuperTexts? Contact us. Our Happiness Engineers are standing by to help!
