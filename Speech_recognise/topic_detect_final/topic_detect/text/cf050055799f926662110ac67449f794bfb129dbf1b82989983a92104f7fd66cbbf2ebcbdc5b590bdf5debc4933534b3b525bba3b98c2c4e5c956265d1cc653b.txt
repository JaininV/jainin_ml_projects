If you are after a quick, but nourishing meal, then a stir fry is a great choice.

Asparagus season runs from April to June, so catch this vegetable when it's at its best to enjoy in this easy meal.

We suggest serving this stir fry with brown rice for a healthier option, but it would work well with a white rice variety too. It would also work with noodles just as is, too.

We've used rump steak as it's flavoursome whilst remaining budget friendly, but splash out on fillet if you fancy!

If you are after more quick and easy dinner recipes, then we have plenty to choose from.
