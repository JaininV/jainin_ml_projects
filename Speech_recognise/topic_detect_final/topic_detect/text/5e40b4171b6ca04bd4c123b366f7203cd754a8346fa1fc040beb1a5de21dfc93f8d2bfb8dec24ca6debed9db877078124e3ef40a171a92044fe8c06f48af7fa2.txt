THERE were 15 teams who nominated for the Port MacDonnell Bowling Club’s Mixed Pairs Championship recently.

Chris Richards and Judy Grosvenor defeated Victor Perryman and Suzzann Connell in the first round to kick-start their title defence in style.

The duo then defeated Nick Negline and Robin Burley before overcoming Carol and Barrie Schmidt in a very close game which went down to the final end.

Richards and Grosvenor’s one-shot win over Carol and Barrie Schmidt meant they were in the grand final once again and had the chance to claim back-to-back championships.

In the other end of the bracket, Adam Wilson and Sharon Perryman defeated Danny Gaut and Shirley Taylor in the first round.

Wilson and Perryman then defeated Nell and Graham Lucas before emerging victorious over David and Julie Beaman to advance to the final against Richards and Grosvenor.

The final was an even contest early with teams trading blows and after six ends, Richards and Grosvenor held 6-5 lead.

However, the game opened up over the next three ends and the reigning champions extended their lead to five after the ninth end.

With momentum on their side, everything was running smoothly for Richards and Grosvenor but Wilson hit back on the 10th end to reduce the deficit to one shot with five ends to play.

In a nail-biting contest, there was nothing to separate the two teams after 15 ends and an extra end was needed to be played to determine a winner.

With nerves of steel, Richards and Grosvenor stood tall when it mattered most and scored one on the extra end to claim the championship.
