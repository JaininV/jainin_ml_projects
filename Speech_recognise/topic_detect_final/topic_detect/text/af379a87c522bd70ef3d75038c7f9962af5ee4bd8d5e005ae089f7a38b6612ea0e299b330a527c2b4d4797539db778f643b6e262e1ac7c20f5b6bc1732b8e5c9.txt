Mayor Stacy Wight, who brought forth the resolution stated “women have been historically underrepresented in politics and continue to face barriers and discrimination in their pursuit of elected office.

“Misogyny and harassment have been identified as significant challenges for women in politics. I am asking that we resolve to express our support of women in politics; their right to participate in the political environment that is free from misogyny and harassment.”

After the meeting, Mayor Wight went on to say “you have to remember there are 444 municipalities across Ontario and there are less than 300 women that sit on those seats. An average council size from what I have seen is five members so if you do the math we are still in a very low percentage.”
