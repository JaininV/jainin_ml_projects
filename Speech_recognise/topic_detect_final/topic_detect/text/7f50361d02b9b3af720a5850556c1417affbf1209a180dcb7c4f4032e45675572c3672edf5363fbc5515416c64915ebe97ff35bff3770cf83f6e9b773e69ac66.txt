Players can expect not one but two events, according to the in-game calendar.

The first event is currently slated to begin on May 25, 2023, and end on June 13, 2023. From the description, it appears we’ll see Treasure Goblins spawn in the open world. They will provide players with loot, but it is unknown what they will drop.

Event Description: Strange winds blow in from another world, and sightings of odd, bag-holding creatures spot the land… Find them, and see what treasure they may hold!

The second Diablo event in World of Warcraft is called Welcome to Sanctuary. As the name suggests, this is most likely when the Winds of Sanctuary buff becomes available. The event will begin on June 15, 2023, and end on July 10, 2023.
