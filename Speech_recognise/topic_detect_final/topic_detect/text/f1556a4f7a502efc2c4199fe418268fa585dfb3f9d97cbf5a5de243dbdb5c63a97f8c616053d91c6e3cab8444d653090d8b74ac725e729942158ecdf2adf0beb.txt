Hello! My name is Yueyang Zhao. I am from Shanghai, China. Currently, I am a graduate student in the EAE program at the University of Utah. I am now working on a student project called Echo of the Last Light alongside some incredible developers from my cohort.

My first stylized game project is called The Great Gnome Hat Off!, which is an alt-control party game with a top-down camera angle. It was a lot of fun working on that project but I kept thinking of creating a more immersive 3D game environment with a stylized art style where players can walk around and explore freely. So I started learning Unreal Engine after that project and I think the new Unreal Engine 5 really gave me the opportunity to make this come true.

I started my project House in the Forest in November 2022 as the final of my school class Game Art III by Jeremy Hodges. I learned a lot about the principles of lighting for games during the class. Jeremy also helped me solve technical issues and gave me a lot of valuable feedback when I was working on this project.
