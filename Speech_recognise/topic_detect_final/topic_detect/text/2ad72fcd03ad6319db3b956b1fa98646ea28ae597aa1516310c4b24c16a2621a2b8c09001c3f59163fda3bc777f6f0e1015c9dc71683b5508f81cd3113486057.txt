The City of Northfield in Atlantic County has SO much to offer! From amazing restaurants and bakeries to family-friendly attractions, Northfield is small, only about 3.5 square miles, but pretty freakin' awesome.

There's so much to see and do! Like the Northfield Police Department.

Ha! Nice, but you don't want to end up THERE.
