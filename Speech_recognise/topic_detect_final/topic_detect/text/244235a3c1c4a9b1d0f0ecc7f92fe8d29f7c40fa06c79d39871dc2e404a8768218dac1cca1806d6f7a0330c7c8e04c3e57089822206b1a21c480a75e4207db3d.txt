The world of cryptocurrency has seen a rise in meme coins, with Dogecoin being one of the most popular ones. Its success has led to the emergence of several other meme coins, including Floki Inu. The question now is, can Floki Inu challenge Dogecoin for the top memecoin?

This article will compare and analyse the similarities and differences between these two meme coins, their utility, and their value. We will also introduce Big Eyes Coin as a viable investment for the 2023/2024 bull market.

Dogecoin is a decentralised, peer-to-peer digital currency based on the popular “Doge” meme, created in 2013 as a joke by software engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer. The Dogecoin community is known for its lightheartedness, humour, and charitable initiatives, making it one of the most relatable crypto communities and platforms.

Thanks to the endorsements by Elon Musk and the crypto community, Dogecoin has a market cap of over $40 billion, making it the top meme coin. The coin’s utility is limited and primarily used as a speculative investment. However, several businesses now accept Dogecoin as a form of payment, making it more practical.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a relatively new meme coin that has gained attention in the crypto community thanks to its founder’s engagement with Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum. Buterin was given half of the Shiba Inu supply, which he donated to India’s COVID-19 relief fund. This act of philanthropy made headlines and boosted Shiba Inu’s popularity.

While both Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have unique selling points, the question remains: whose support is more influential in the market, Musk’s or Buterin’s? The answer could be clearer-cut, as both have significantly impacted the coins’ value.

However, it’s worth noting that Musk’s tweets have a more significant reach, with the Tesla CEO having over 60 million followers on Twitter compared to Buterin’s 2 million. While one is a cryptocurrency leader, the other influences the cryptocurrency’s price. As per usual, capitalism wins over philanthropy when it comes to amassing followers.

Big Eyes Coin, however, manages to do both. It is a deflationary token that aims to provide a long-term investment opportunity for its holders and change how they engage with finances and charitable endeavours.

The cat with big eyes wants to save the world—including its fish. BIG donates 5% of its assets to organisations that aim to save the ocean, including The Sea Shepherd and Orca Network.

The non-profit Orca Network, established in 1996, devotes its efforts to reporting on Salish sea whale issues, sightings, and events. On its website, Orca Network offers articles about marine animals and fact sheets about the Southern Resident Community of Orcas.

An organisation dedicated to protecting the oceans, The Sea Shepherd, was created in 1977. They stand up for all marine life, including krill, fish, and sharks. Good news for Big Eyes Coin’s cat companion! The coin’s value is expected to rise steadily as its supply decreases, making it a viable investment for the 2023/2024 bull market.

Big Eyes Coin’s utility is limited, but it aims to become a community-driven project that provides value to its holders. The coin’s website promises “exciting community events and charity initiatives” to engage its community.
