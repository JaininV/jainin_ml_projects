Liverpool coach, Jurgen Klopp has insisted that his boys played the ‘best game’ of their season against Leeds on Monday, as they stormed to a 6-1 victory at Elland Road.

Goals from Mohamed Salah, Darwin Nunez, Cody Gakpo and Diogo Jota on the night ensured Liverpool ran away with six goals from the Etihad.

The result has kept their momentum alive for a place in Europe next season, whether that be the Europa League or the Conference League, and after the game Klopp insisted the result was ‘exactly what we wanted’.

Speaking to Sky Sports, he said: ‘[I enjoyed it] a lot! I think it’s the best game we’ve played this season, from all different perspectives.

‘It was a really good game, sensational goals. Counter-pressing-wise, [the] best game, [I was] close to saying [in] decades, but it was really long ago!’
