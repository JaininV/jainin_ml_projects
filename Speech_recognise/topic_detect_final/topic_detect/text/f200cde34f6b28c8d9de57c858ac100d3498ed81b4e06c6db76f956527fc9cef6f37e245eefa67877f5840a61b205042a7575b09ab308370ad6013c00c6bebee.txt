Hand & Stone Massage and Facial Spa opened its doors last month, offering customers hot stone massages, facials, and hair removal treatments.

The franchise – first launched in 2004 – has more than 550 locations in the United States and Canada, Tulare County now included.

“Opening in Visalia, a community filled with the majestic Sierra Nevada views… It checks all of my boxes,” first-time business owner Rosie Dunkle said, “I am most excited to provide locals with accessible massage and skincare services to help residents look and feel their best.”

Visalians have a few massage options, including Swedish, Himalayan salt, hot stone, decompression therapy, percussive therapy, sports, deep tissue, oncology, and prenatal.

Hand & Stone Massage and Facial Spa use advanced skincare products – like Dermalogica and ClarityRX. They have a handful of skincare options, including diamond glow, NuFACE microcurrent, and LED phototherapy facials, and each treatment is tailored to each individual's needs or skin concerns.

Service prices vary; however, introductory prices start at $79.95 for a one-hour massage or facial. For a list of all the services the business offers, click visit https://handandstone.com/.
