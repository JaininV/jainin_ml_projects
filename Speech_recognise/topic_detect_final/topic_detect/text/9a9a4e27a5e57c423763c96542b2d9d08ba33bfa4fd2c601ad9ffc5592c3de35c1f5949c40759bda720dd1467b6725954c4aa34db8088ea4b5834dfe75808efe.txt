The trading volume for XRP has been soaring, with an impressive $1,010,492,686 in the past 24 hours, accounting for 70.00% of its market capitalization. It is no surprise that XRP is considered a hot topic in the cryptocurrency market, currently ranked as the sixth largest by market capitalization, with a market dominance of 2.11%. The high volume-to-market cap ratio of 0.03819 indicates a strong interest from traders.

Looking at the 1-hour chart above, XRP has broken the 200-day moving average and is now trading under it. However, there is no clear pattern that XRP will become bearish in the future as there is lots of news in the market and buyers have been favoring accumulating XRP.

Currently, according to the chart, if XRP tends to bounce back from the current 200-day moving average line and rise higher, it has a possibility of breaking out the resistance at $0.5295 and reaching up to $0.5388. However, another scenario is that XRP can also break the support zone at $0.5010 and dump as low as $0.4950.

Also, the relative strength index (RSI) value of XRP is currently staying at 44.24, meaning that the cryptocurrency is almost oversold, providing a potential buying opportunity for traders looking to capitalize on the market conditions.

With XRP’s trading volume remaining high and its market rank showing no signs of slowing down, it will be interesting to see how this cryptocurrency continues to perform in the coming days and weeks.
