Mercedes said it intended to withdraw from the market and that the sale of shares in its subsidiaries to Avtodom had now been granted approval.  “The completion of the transaction is now particularly subject to the implementation of the contractual agreements,” Mercedes said in a statement. “We strive for a quick implementation.  “We have agreed an option with the buyer, according to which we could buy back the shares in companies if the sanctions are lifted again.”  The buyback clause has been a particularly popular option with carmakers exiting the market in response to Russia sending tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine in February 2022.  France’s Renault sold its majority stake in Russia’s Avtovaz for reportedly just one rouble, but with a six-year option to buy it back. Japan’s Nissan handed over its business in Russia to a state-owned entity for one euro.  A Russian register of companies showed that Avtodom had become the owner of 100% stakes in Mercedes-Benz Capital Rus and Mercedes-Benz Manufacturing Rus on April 18.  Interfax quoted Avtodom as saying that the deal with Mercedes was not yet finalized and that hard work with government agencies was underway to close the deal.  Avtodom did not immediately respond to a request for comment. (Reporting by Alexander Marrow and Victoria Waldersee, Editing by Louise Heavens)
