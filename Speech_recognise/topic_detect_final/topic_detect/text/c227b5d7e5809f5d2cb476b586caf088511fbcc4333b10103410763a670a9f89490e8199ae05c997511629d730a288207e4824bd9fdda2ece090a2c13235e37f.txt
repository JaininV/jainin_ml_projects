JOHOR Menteri Besar Onn Hafiz Ghazi has expressed hope that the efficiency level at the Customs, Immigration and Quarantine (CIQ) Complex in the Sultan Iskandar Building (BSI) in Johor Baru will reach 100% throughout the Hari Raya festive season.

He said optimal operational efficiency was needed to ensure the smooth movement of travellers, thus reducing congestion on the land route between Malaysia and Singapore via the Johor Causeway.

“This CIQ is the busiest in the world and will be even busier after this. However, from today’s visit, I can say that the efficiency level is not at 100%. For me, it is only 80%.

“All counters for pedestrians, cars, motorcycles and buses must be fully opened. If there is any technical problem or lack of manpower issue, it must be resolved immediately,” he told reporters after inspecting the CIQ operation early this morning.

Onn Hafiz also invited the newly appointed Immigration director-general Ruslin Jusoh to visit the CIQ as soon as possible to find the best solutions to improve its efficiency.

“Malaysians and I hope CIQ BSI can operate at full capacity. We are concerned with the welfare of immigration personnel who are struggling to cope with the increase in the number of travellers.

“I also received reports that sometimes, their overtime claims took too long to be settled. I hope this can be resolved immediately within a day or two,” he said.

Last Friday, Johor Police Chief Kamarul Zamat Mamat said about two million vehicles are expected to enter Johor, via the Johor Causeway and the Malaysia-Singapore Second Link in conjunction with Hari Raya. – Bernama, April 19, 2023.
