>Spawn is a Hellspawn sent to Earth to deliver evil souls to Hell. However, Spawn became the pseudo-protector of New York City, fighting against Heaven and Hell alike. The legacy of Hellspawns spans throughout history tapping into the enigmatic Necroplasm and sinister creatures - such as worms, bats, and wolves - to gain their powers. Spawn was created by Todd McFarlane in his original incarnation. He first appeared in Spawn #1 (1992).
