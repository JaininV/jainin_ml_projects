VALLEJO — Wildfire Community Preparedness Day is coming in May.

This is a day to roll up your sleeves and do some real clean up work to make a difference at Hanns Park where volunteers will be clearing fire-prone vegetation.

The event will take place from 9 a.m. to noon May 6 at the Hanns Park, 198 Skyline Drive, Vallejo.

The public is invited to attend and volunteer with family and friends to learn about wildfire preparedness and help remove fire-prone invasive species from local parks. Register in advance. Event details provided with registration. Volunteers must be 10 and older.

“We are thrilled to join the Vallejo Watershed Alliance, the Greater Vallejo Recreation District, and CVNL to help protect Vallejo’s hidden gem, Hanns Park, from threats of wildfire,” Jennifer Kaiser Nelson, public information officer at Vallejo Flood & Wastewater District, said in a press release.

The Hanns Park Wildfire Community Preparation Event is part of the Climate Impact Wildfire Prevention Project whose mission is to engage community members in Days of Service wildfire prevention events where they will remove fire-prone vegetation and help make communities more firesafe.
