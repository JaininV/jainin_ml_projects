Prince Harry will be attending King Charles’s Coronation ceremony but his wife will not be by his side for the grand royal moment.

Sources from local media outlets were quick to confirm how Meghan Markle will stay in Lon Angeles and that leaves her husband alone to attend and face the royals in Buckingham Palace.

The news comes after a great amount of speculation arose against whether or not Harry would be in attendance with his wife and it appears now that while the Duke of Sussex would be there to attend, Meghan would not be by his side during this time.

Insider sources revealed how Harry is all set to make his way to Buckingham Palace alone as he meets with senior members of the royal family after ties were severed since the launch of his memoir.

The news comes as sources spoke about how Harry and Meghan will not be given any form of a privilege or RSVP tag at the ceremony and that really had organizers in shock because, at the end of the day, Harry is the younger son of the King.

As of now, it’s not quite clear why Meghan Markle has chosen to stay behind. The reason outlined so far is so she could be with her kids but speculations arise about how the Duchess is willing to keep herself away from any drama that might overshadow the high-profile event.

Harry will witness his father King Charles and stepmom Queen Consort Camilla be coronated in a ceremony that is scheduled for next month.

This is the name given to an age-old practice that arises in the form of a ceremony that dates back thousands of years ago.

The event will reportedly take place in Westminister Abbey and this is where all senior members of the royal family are expected to attend the gathering.

What are your thoughts on Meghan Markle staying behind for such a high-prestige and honorable royal event, despite being invited by the King?
