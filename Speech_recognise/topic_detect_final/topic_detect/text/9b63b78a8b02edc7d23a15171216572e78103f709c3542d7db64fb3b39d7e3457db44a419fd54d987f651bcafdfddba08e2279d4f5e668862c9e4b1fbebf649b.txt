In conclusion, public health may not wear cape of fly through the air, but it is a true superhero. It has the power to transform communities, save lives, and improve the health of people around the world. So the next time you hear about public health, remember that it’s not just a field – it’s a force for good that we can all support.

Did you know public health has saved more lives than medical treatment or procedures? Or that for every $1 invested in public health, we save $5.60 in healthcare costs? (APHA) Public health is a powerful force that can transform communities and save lives. But what is public health, exactly?

Simply put, public health is the science of protecting and improving the health of people and their communities. It’s a multidisciplinary field that includes everything from epidemiology and biostatistics to environmental health and health policy. Public health professionals work to prevent illness and injury by identifying and addressing the root causes of health problems, promoting healthy behaviors and environments, and responding to outbreaks and emergencies.

So why is public health so important?

Well, for starters, it helps us live longer, healthier lives. Public health initiatives like vaccinations, clean water and sanitation, and smoke-free laws have significantly increased life expectancy over the past century. Public health also helps reduce healthcare costs by preventing diseases and injuries before they occur. This means fewer hospitalizations, fewer expensive treatments, and a healthier population overall.

One specific example of public health is the fight against the HIV/AIDS epidemic. In the 1980s and 90s, HIV/AIDS was a death sentence (Russell – CNN, 2016). But public health professionals worked tirelessly to develop effective treatments, promote safe sex practices, and reduce the stigma associated with the disease. As a result, HIV/AIDS is now a manageable chronic condition rather than a death sentence.

Another example of public health in action is the response to the current pandemic of COVID-19. Public health officials have been working around the clock to track the spread of the virus, promote vaccination, and develop effective treatments. They have also been working to address the social and economic impacts of the pandemic, such as job loss and food insecurity.
