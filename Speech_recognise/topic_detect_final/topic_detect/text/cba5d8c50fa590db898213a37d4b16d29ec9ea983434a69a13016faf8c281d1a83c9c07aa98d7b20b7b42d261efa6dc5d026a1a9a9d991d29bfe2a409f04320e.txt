Poultry farmers have urged the Welsh government to make a bird flu vaccine available to avoid future outbreaks of the virus, BBC reported.

Some countries outside of Europe are already using a vaccine. But the Welsh government said that hygiene and biosecurity measures provide the best protection against the spread of bird flu.

Wales has had six confirmed cases of bird flu since October 2022.

The most recent case of bird flu was confirmed last Thursday at a premises near Newtown, Powys.

Poultry had been kept indoors since December 2, 2022 to avoid disease transmission.

With the exception of a 3 km restriction area near Newtown, birds are now permitted outside in Wales.

Poultry keepers will only release birds for an hour at a time to allow them to adjust to daylight after being kept indoors for so long.

Vaccination is a contentious solution because there is insufficient evidence that countries that have implemented the vaccine have been able to control the virus.

The National Farmers' Union (NFU) of Wales said vaccination has some positive effects but does not solve all problems.

Dr. Richard Irvine, Wales' chief veterinary officer, said that while a vaccine is not ruled out in the future, other measures are currently more effective.

Dr Irvine said they are working with their counterparts in Defra and the Scottish government, as well as with the veterinary medicines directorate to monitor the availability of avian influenza vaccines, and working closely with counterparts internationally to keep a close eye on the situation as it develops.

He said one of the fundamental requirements for vaccines is that they be both protective and effective, adding that the best way to keep avian influenza away is to practise strict hygiene and biosecurity.
