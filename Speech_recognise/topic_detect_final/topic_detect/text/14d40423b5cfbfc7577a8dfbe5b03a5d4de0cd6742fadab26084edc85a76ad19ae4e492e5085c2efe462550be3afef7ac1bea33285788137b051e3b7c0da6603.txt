Sneakers for work, of course, are still controversial — know your office before wearing one! If you CAN wear sneakers to work, it can even be controversial what KIND of sneakers are appropriate.

Here are a few things that I think this one has going for it:

* It doesn’t look like it was run over in the street.

* The design is just a BIT more than your basic white sneaker — that beige leather strip around the sole almost makes it look like it has a platform look

All in all, I like it! It’s $150 at Nordstrom and Cole Haan, available in sizes 5-11. (There are six other colorways as well.)

Psst: I’m going to update this post on the best sneakers for work outfits soon — what are your latest favorites, readers? What do YOU look for in a sneaker for work?
