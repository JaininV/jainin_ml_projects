Lionel Messi, the seven-time Ballon d'Or winner and one of the most decorated football players in history, has displayed his generosity by gifting one of his prestigious awards to his former Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) teammate, Leandro Paredes. Messi's illustrious career has been filled with numerous titles, including 10 La Liga titles, four Champions League trophies, a Copa America triumph, and even World Cup glory. In addition, he has received countless individual awards, one of which he passed on to Paredes - the Liga 2020-21 Best Player award.

During a tour of his home, Paredes, who is currently on loan at Serie A giants Juventus, revealed that he had acquired the prestigious award from Messi. It now sits alongside a signed ball from a World Cup triumph in Qatar. Paredes recalled asking Messi if he could have the award, to which Messi graciously agreed and gave it to him.

This act of generosity comes despite past tensions between Messi and Paredes on the football pitch. Paredes had previously shared that Messi once became angry with him during a meeting between Barcelona and PSG in the Champions League, stating that Messi "wanted to kill" him due to a comment Paredes made to his teammates. However, any differences between the two players appear to have been put aside, with Messi even being linked with a potential return to Barcelona as his contract with PSG approaches its end.

Messi's selfless gesture in giving away one of his coveted awards to a former teammate has drawn attention to his humility and generosity, further solidifying his status as one of football's most respected and admired players. As fans eagerly await Messi's next move in his storied career, this act of kindness serves as a reminder of his remarkable achievements on and off the field.
