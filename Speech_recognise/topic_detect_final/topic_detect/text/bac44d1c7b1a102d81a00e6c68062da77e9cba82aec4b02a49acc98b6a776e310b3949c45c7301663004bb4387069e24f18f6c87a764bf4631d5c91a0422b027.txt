A High Court of the Federal Capital Territory in Maitama, Abuja, has cleared the President of the Association of Senior Civil Servants of Nigeria, Innocent Bola-Audu, and three others, of human trafficking charges.

Justice Charles Agbaza, on Tuesday, discharged and acquitted the defendants on the grounds that the prosecution failed to provide evidence linking them to the alleged offence.

The National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons had on July 7, 2021 arraigned the ASCSN president and the three others before the court, but they pleaded not guilty to the charges pressed against them.

After the prosecution closed its case, the defendants filed a no-case submission, urging the court to free them on the contention that the prosecution failed to prove the charges against them.

Ruling on Tuesday, Justice Agbaza agreed with the defendants that NAPTIP failed to prove the case.

The Judge held: “The prosecution has not clearly been able to link the defendants with the charge brought against them. I find it difficult to come to terms with the prosecution on the charges and in his argument against the defendants.

“There is no evidence before this court linking the defendants with the offence. The prosecution failed to establish a case of human trafficking against the defendants.

“The defendants are hereby discharged and acquitted.”

Speaking with journalists after his discharge by the court, Bola-Audu said the case preferred against him and three others by NAPTIP was politically motivated to malign him but he was happy that he had been vindicated.
