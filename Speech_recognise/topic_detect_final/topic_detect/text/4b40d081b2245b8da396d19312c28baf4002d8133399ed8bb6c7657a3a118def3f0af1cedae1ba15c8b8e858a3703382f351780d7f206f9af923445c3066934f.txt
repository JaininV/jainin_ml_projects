MANCHESTER UNITED will be without star man Bruno Fernandes for their Europa League quarter-final second leg clash with Sevilla.

The Red Devils surrendered a two-goal lead in the first leg after two late own-goals from Tyrell Malacia and Harry Maguire.

They now travel to the Ramon Sanchez-Pizjuan in need of an away win against the 6-time Europa League champions.

Eric ten Hag will have to overcome Sevilla on their own patch without the help of instrumental playmaker Bruno Fernandes.

The Portuguese international will be unavailable after picking up three yellow cards in the Europa League this campaign.

His final booking was picked up for a very harsh handball decision in the first leg at Old Trafford last week.

Fernandes was unplayable in United's 2-0 win away at Nottingham Forest on the weekend.

There is no doubt the Red Devils will miss his creative ability in the final third at Sevilla.

If fit, Marcel Sabitzer could fill the shoes of the 28-year-old for the huge European clash in Spain.

He flourished in the more advanced midfield role in the first leg, scoring a brace on the night.

The Austrian was due to start against Nottingham Forest on Sunday but was pulled out of the warm-up at the City Ground as a precution.

Should Sabitzer not be fit for the second leg, Ten Hag could deploy Christian Eriksen in the more advanced role and have Fred join Casemiro as the holding midfield pair.

* Sevilla vs Man United will take place on Thursday, April 20.

* Kick off will be at 8pm UK time.
