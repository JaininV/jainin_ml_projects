The Niagara Region has dozens of places where residents can snap some shots of Cherry Blossoms as they bloom in the next week or two. The reason is simple: where wineries and fruit orchards thrive, so too do the Cherry Blossom trees.

However, in Niagara Falls and St. Catharines, there are two must-see locations that are simply, well, bloomin’ spectacular for their beauty.

In Niagara Falls, which is already a city heavily-laden with floral displays year-round, Niagara Parks Botanical Gardens, a 99-acre park, is loaded with Japanese cherry trees, as well as other gorgeous blooms here, including their world-famous rose garden with over 2,000 roses.

However, if we can stray slightly from cherry-blossom-specific, we would suggest the city’s Magnolia Alley steals the show. While technically a slightly different strain of flower, with their pinkish hue, to those of us who are not botanists, they look virtually identical. Be warned: the magnolia blossoms are huge.

Head over to the Niagara Parks Floral Showhouse, already a eye-dazzler of every possible colour in the spectrum, and Magnolia Alley is right beside it.

In St. Catharines, there are literally dozens of places to spot Cherry Blossoms, including private properties which are best avoided, head over the Garden City campus of Brock University – see video below – for a stunning display.

In 2003, the Japanese government donated 100 Sakura cherry trees to Brock University as a gesture of friendship and 20 years later, they are stunning to observe.

If you’d like a comprehensive list for all of Niagara Region, there are dozens of Cherry Blossom destinations to be found on Google.
