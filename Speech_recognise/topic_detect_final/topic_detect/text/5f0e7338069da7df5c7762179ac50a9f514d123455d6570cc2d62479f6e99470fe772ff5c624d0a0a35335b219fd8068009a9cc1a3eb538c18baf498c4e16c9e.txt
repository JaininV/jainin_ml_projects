Pasta dishes are an excellent way to showcase seasonal produce; in the springtime, this means asparagus, ramps, peas, artichokes, and more bright, fresh flavors. If you're looking for something less veggie-focused but still seasonally appropriate, try a classic linguine and clams (perfect for eating outdoors) or some simple spaghettoni with butter and brewer's yeast.
