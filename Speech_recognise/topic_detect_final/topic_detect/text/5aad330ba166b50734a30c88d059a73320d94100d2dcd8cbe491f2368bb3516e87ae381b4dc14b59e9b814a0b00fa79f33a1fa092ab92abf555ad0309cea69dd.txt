Chance The Rapper has come under fire after a video showed him dancing provocatively with a woman at Jamaica’s Carnaval festival, with some accusing him of cheating on his wife.

The video in question made the rounds over the weekend and shows Chance enjoying himself at the annual Jamaican festival as he dances up on a twerking woman.

While most were supportive of Chance having a good time, some people began accusing the Acid Rap lyricist of cheating on his wife Kirsten Corley, whom he’s been married to for over four years.

“Ain’t you married?” one user asked on Twitter, while another wrote: “Chancellor where is yo wifeeee” along with a photo of Will Smith wearing an unimpressed look on his face.

“So is Chance the Rapper still married?? If yes, then bombastic side eye,” wrote another critic.

However, other fans came to Chance’s defense, reminding the haters that it was Carnaval and that the rapper was just indulging in the culture.

“They’re mad at Chance the Rapper for ‘cheating on his wife,'” tweeted one supporter. “Y’all Don’t bring that European nonsense to this ethnic household and let that man enjoy Caribbean culture.”

“Americans don’t even understand the concept of Carnival,” another added. “Chance The Rapper reveling and all of them saying he’s cheating lol … cultural deficit much.”

Chance The Rapper and Kirsten Corley got married back in 2019 at the Pelican Hill resort in Newport Beach, California. E! News reported at the time that the wedding was attended by 150 family members and friends, along with celebrities such as Dave Chappelle, Kanye West and Kim Kardashian.

Chance’s loving marriage was heavily rapped about on his critically-panned album The Big Day,, which HipHopDX awarded a middling 2.3 rating and named it one of the most disappointing albums of 2019

While Chance has yet to responded to the backlash over the Carnival footage, Fivio Foreign went through a similar cheating scandal earlier this year when a video showed him dancing up on Asian Doll. Fivio’s girlfriend Jasmine Giselle promptly called out the Brooklyn rapper on Instagram Live.

“You moving around acting like you single and you’re not,” she said at the time. “That’s your problem. You’re not single.”

In his initial response, Fivio called the world “demonic” because he couldn’t dance with “his friend.”
