Reports have claimed that Eden Hazard made sure to acknowledge a number of Chelsea fans who were leaving early from Stamford Bridge last night.

According to Football London, the Belgian did his best to wave to the home supporters despite not getting on the pitch yesterday.

Real Madrid booked their place in the semi-finals of the Champions League after withstanding early Chelsea pressure, eventually running out 4-0 aggregate winners.

It was the third successive trip back to West London where Hazard was unable to receive what would have surely been an extremely warm reception.

It has perhaps been forgotten by some just how good the player was when he was the most important player in the Premier League.

His brilliance earned him a move to Madrid, where he looked set to take the next step towards being recognised as one of the best players in the world.

Injuries and off-field issues have seen his career tailspin though, and now he hardly makes appearances in La Liga.

It can be said that this had an effect on his recent World Cup campaign in Qatar. After Belgiumâ€™s group stage exit, he announced his retirement from the international side.

While he may not have got on last night, he made sure to acknowledge the Chelsea fans who were desperate for his attention by the benches.

It seems as if Hazard may be on the move at the end of the season, with Stamford Bridge always being mentioned as a potential landing spot for him after his Madrid career came to an end.

However, the player himself has previously claimed he is unsure where those links have come from, given there have been no discussions over a potential transfer back to West London in the future.
