The Iowa Legislature is continuing work on a budget, with the House and Senate currently working to come to an agreement regarding the final numbers. State Senator Julian Garrett tells KNIA News the House is $90 million above the Senate as of the negotiations on Friday, and the Senate is trying to follow the proposed budget from Governor Reynolds. Senator Garrett said he chairs the Justice Systems Subcommittee, which controls approximately 10% of the state general fund, but they can’t move forward with the final numbers until an overall budget number is set.

“I think we can have an agreement any day now, then we’ll be able to, not only myself but the other budget subcommittee chairs, will be able to work on the details of the budgets. That’s usually the thing that determines when we can adjourn the session, when we get a budget we can agree to.”
