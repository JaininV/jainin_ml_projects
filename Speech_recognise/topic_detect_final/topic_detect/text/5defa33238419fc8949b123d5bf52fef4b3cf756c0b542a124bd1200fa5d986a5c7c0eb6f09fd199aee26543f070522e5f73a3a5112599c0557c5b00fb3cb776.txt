Priyanka Chopra calls daughter Malti Marie her 'little traveller'; says 'I've been travelling since I was 4-5 months, so its the same for her'Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas are one globe-trotting couple. When not travelling for shoots, the two are jetting off on romantic holidays with their baby girl.

While promoting her new show, PeeCee was asked about taking daughter Malti Marie along for the ride to all kinds of exotic locations around the world. Reacting to the same, Priyanka told Entertainment Tonight, "She's a little traveller. But, my parents raised me like that and so was my husband."

"My dad and mom were both in the military, so I started travelling when I was very young when I was 4-5 months. So, it's the same for her. Right now she is not in school, so we can take her along to wherever we want," she said and concluded, "Also we love spending as much time with her."
