Starring Brie Larson as Captain Marvel, The Marvels just released its first trailer. The movie also features Iman Vellani as Kamala Khan and Teyonah Parris as Monica Rambeau. Park Seo Joon fans will also be happy to catch a glimpse of the Korean actor as Prince Yan D’ Aladna.

The first poster, showcasing the three female leads together as they face off against new enemies, was also released. Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige revealed that the style of The Marvels will be similar to The Avengers where it will feature a small team of heroes.

He added that Kamala Khan’s character  demonstrates her charm and shows significant character development in The Marvels. “I know this is a spoiler, but she basically steals the show in The Marvels.” He compared her character to Tom Holland in Captain America: Civil War, who possesses a naïve energy when standing alongside the other heroes.

The movie is slated to be released on November 10, 2023.
