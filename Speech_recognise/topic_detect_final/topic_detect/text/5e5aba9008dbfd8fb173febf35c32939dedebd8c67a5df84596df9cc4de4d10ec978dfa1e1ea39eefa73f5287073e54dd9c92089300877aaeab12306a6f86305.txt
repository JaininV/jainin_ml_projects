Thongvang, 35, and Tongleng Lo, 33, were sentenced to death by the Quang Tri People’s Committee for the illegal trade of narcotic substances.

At around 4:30 p.m. on August 22, 2021, Vietnamese border guards at Huong Lap found a group of people carrying bags in Ka Tieng Village, Huong Hoa District.

The guards wanted to stop the group for a document check, but the group fled to the other side of the border, leaving the bags behind. Authorities managed to capture Thongvang and Tongleng Lo, while the rest got away.

Inside the bags were 46 plastic bags containing around 45.7 kg of meth.

At the court, the two Laotians said they were hired by a person in Laos to traffic drugs into Vietnam. On August 22, 2021, the group used a car to transport the drugs from Laos’s Bolikhamsay Province to Savannakhet Province, which borders Quang Tri.

Tongleng said he was hired for 5 million Lao Kip ($290.61), while Thongvang said he was promised $5,000.
