Liverpool now face competition from Manchester City in the race to sign Napoli star Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, according to TalkSPORT.

As per the report, both the Reds and the Sky Blues are interested in landing the 22-year-old in the summer.

Spanish giants Real Madrid are also named with interest, but it is said that the player is fully focused on Napoli at the moment.

However, according to Get Football News Italy, the Georgian is expected to sign a new contract with the Serie A outfit in June.

While Calciomercato claim Liverpool are chasing the attacker, they admit it may be a difficult deal to pull off, as Napoli value the youngster upwards of £90m.

Having only arrived in Italy last summer, Kvaratskhelia has exploded onto the European football scene.

In 34 appearances this season, the left-winger has bagged 14 goals and 16 assists.

He currently leads Napoli in match stats, helping the side to the top of the table, as they fight to win their first Scudetto in over 30 years.

Kvaratskhelia’s rise in the Serie A has been nothing short of phenomenal, and he has been rightly deemed ‘the most exciting player in Europe’ by CBS pundit Jamie Carragher.

As signings go, the 22-year-old would be an incredible acquisition for Liverpool.

However, his price-tag would likely be far more than the £90m reported, so it’s unlikely the Reds have any chance of landing him.
