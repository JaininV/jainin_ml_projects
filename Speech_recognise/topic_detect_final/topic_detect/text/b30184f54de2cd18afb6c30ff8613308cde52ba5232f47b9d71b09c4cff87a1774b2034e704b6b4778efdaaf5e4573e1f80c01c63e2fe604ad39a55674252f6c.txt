Rashford could return from a groin injury for United’s Europa League quarter-final return leg with Sevilla.

The tie is delicately poised at 2-2 after United conceded two late goals in the first leg at Old Trafford.

“We’re not going to change our mentality or idea if Rashford plays or not,” Mendilibar said.

Rashford could return from a groin injury for United’s Europa League quarter-final return leg with Sevilla.

The tie is delicately poised at 2-2 after United conceded two late goals in the first leg at Old Trafford.

“We’re not going to change our mentality or idea if Rashford plays or not,” Mendilibar said.

“Well, Rashford is one of the best players nowadays. We have to think about ourselves, respecting the opposite team but we don’t have to think about particular players.

“If Rashford plays, it’s because he’s ready. If he’s not, another top player will play there.”
