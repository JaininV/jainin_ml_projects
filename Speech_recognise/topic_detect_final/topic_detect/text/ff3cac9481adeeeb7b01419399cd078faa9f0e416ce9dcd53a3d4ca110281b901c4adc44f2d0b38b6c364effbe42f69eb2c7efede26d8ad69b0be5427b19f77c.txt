According to a report on Metro.co.uk, Chelsea boss Frank Lampard is annoyed with Graham Potter’s decision to drop Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang from Chelsea’s Champions League squad.

Potter dropped Aubameyang from Chelsea’s Champions League squad to accommodate January signings Enzo Fernandez, Mykhailo Mudryk and Joao Felix.

The decision to leave out Aubameyang from Chelsea’s Champions League squad has left Chelsea without a natural No.9 to play in the Champions League however, frustrating Lampard who would have liked to have used the former Arsenal captain, even just as an impact sub.
