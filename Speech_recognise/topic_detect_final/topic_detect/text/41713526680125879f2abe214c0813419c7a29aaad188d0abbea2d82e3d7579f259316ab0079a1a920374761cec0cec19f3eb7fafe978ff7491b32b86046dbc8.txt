The grade 6 students had a lot of fun exploring and reviewing the elements of art. This is to help them with their vocabulary when they are talking about their art.

Here are my class slides. You can make a copy so that you can play the videos and edit the slides as needed.

If you go to Artsonia you will see the timelapse videos. These are fabulous to watch. Here are some action photos of the 2 lesson art challenge.

After reviewing the elements that the students incorporated into their group art, we added on a couple more fun 1 lesson tasks.

The first one used the texture rubbing plates and the second was using tutorials to create a digital artwork showing space. This could be distance or negative and positive space.

There were some brilliant results. A huge shout out to Flo for her phenomenal tutorials. She is one of my favourite Procreate instructors.

Now, the students are applying texture to their functional ceramic pieces. Iâ€™ll write about that in another blog post.
