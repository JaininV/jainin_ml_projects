ZAMBOANGA CITY — The inflation rate in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao has slightly increased last month by about 0.3 percent — to 7.8 percent compared to 7.5 percent last February.

The Philippine Statistics Authority in BARMM reported on Tuesday that the slight surge of the inflation rate this month was mainly due to the increase in growth in the indices of some commodity groups.

These groups include Food and Non-Alcoholic Beverages; Restaurant and Accommodation Services; and Personal Care and Miscellaneous Goods and Services.

Among the provinces in BARMM, Tawi-Tawi recorded the highest inflation rate at 11.7 percent, followed by Basilan at 9.5 percent, Sulu at 8.4 percent, Lanao Del Sur at 7.2 percent while Maguindanao had the lowest inflation rate at 6.4 percent.

The BARMM-PSA report also revealed that Cotabato City has recorded a decrease in its inflation rate — 5.5 percent this March 2023 compared to the 6.6 percent inflation rate in February.

Inflation in the entire country was reduced to 7.6 percent for March as compared to February where it recorded an 8.6 percent inflation rate.

According to Bangsamoro Planning and Development Authority Macro-Economic Planning Division chief Camelia de Vera-Dacanay, the slight increase in the region’s inflation rate is still linked to the adjustment period from the recovery of the Covid-19 pandemic and the fasting month of Ramadan.

“It is expected that the price of basic commodities will increase during the observance of the month-long Ramadan,” Dacanay said.
