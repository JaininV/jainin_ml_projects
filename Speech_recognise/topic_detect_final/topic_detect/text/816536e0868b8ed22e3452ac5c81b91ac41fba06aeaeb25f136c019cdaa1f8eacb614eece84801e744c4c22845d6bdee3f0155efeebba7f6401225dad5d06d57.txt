Vision Brokers and Advisors is a boutique advisory firm specialising in business sales from $500k - $20MM, strategic business exits, mergers, and acquisitions. We have built an exemplary reputation in the business broking sector.

Vision Brokers and Advisors are seeking experienced business brokers who want to take their business broking career to the next level by completing higher quality work, developing more meaningful and fulfilling relationships with clients, and ultimately earning more by selling smarter.

Due to the incredible selling system we have now perfected, Vision Brokers & Advisors is looking to expand to other states. We are looking to for two qualified, successful & meticulous business brokers (one in Melbourne and one in Brisbane) who want the opportunity to become their own licensee.

•	Pays 20%, 30%, 40% or even 50% of your commission to “the firm”.

•	Feels like the tireless work you put into every sale is not rewarded.

•	Is tired of explaining to Vendor’s why there is no interest in their business, and can only say “the market is bad”.

•	Doesn’t understand where “marketing fee’s” actually go, and why there are so little buyer enquiries.

•	Can’t stand to write another “database EDM”, yet it’s the only way you can show the Vendor you are working on something.

•	Resent the fact that another colleague was given a lead that you would be better to sell.

•	Is frustrated by the one team member setting a bad reputation which affects you by extension.

•	Keep 100% of your commission.

•	Sell an average of 4 businesses per year with a median enterprise value of $2MM per business @ 6% commission (you do the math).

•	Generate monthly cash flow from subscription and retainer based fees.

•	Receive more than enough buyer enquiries which the Vendor has full visibility over every day.

•	Genuinely believe the work you do is in the best interests of your clients.

•	Transcend the standards of the business brokering industry.

•	Work in a experienced and friendly non-corporate culture, that promotes a family flexible, happy working environment.

•	Grow your own small, specialist, high earning team.

Our Licensee packages are being offered at foundation rates, for the first two partners, which is a drop in the ocean compared to the commission you paid “the firm” last year.
