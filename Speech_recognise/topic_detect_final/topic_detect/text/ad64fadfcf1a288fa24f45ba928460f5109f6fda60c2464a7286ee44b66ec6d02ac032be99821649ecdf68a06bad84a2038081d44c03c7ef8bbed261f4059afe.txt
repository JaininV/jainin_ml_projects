The leather Mackenzie Original Walker Bag by Miura is one of the most luxurious bags a golfer can carry. These bags are the epitome of quality and class. Spacious enough to carry a full set of clubs, but light enough to not notice.

To produce these bags, Miura sources only the finest buckskin and cream leather coupled with detailed stitching throughout the design.

By the way— If you haven’t tried Miura’s golf clubs yet, you’re missing out. Miura’s been making slub since 1957, created for the best ball-strikers in the world.

Designed and constructed by master craftsman Katsuhiro Miura, each club is individually made using Miura’s patented forging process. To this day, Miura-san continues to work in the factory with his sons, Shinei and Yoshitaka, who proudly carry on the Miura legacy.
