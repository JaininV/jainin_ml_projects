Ja Morant  suffered a hand injury in Game 1  of the Memphis Grizzlies first-round playoff series against the Los Angeles Lakers on Sunday. After an X-Ray and further evaluation, tests have revealed that Morant did not sustain a break or fracture, per Shams Charania. He suffered a soft tissue bruise.

Morant's injury is being monitored for pain. The former lottery pick  rated his pain a 10-out-of-10  after exiting midway through the fourth quarter of Memphis' 128-112 loss to the Lakers on Sunday.

Morant landed awkwardly on his right hand after an attempted dunk and midair collision with Lakers forward Anthony Davis. He immediately subbed out of the game and headed for evaluation in the locker room. He did not re-enter the game.

The star guard said that he will try to play in Game 2, but if he feels the injury will prevent him from helping his team on the court, he will sit out.

Morant is a game-time decision on Wednesday, but ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski "  doesn't sense a great deal of optimism  " surrounding the Grizzlies guard.
