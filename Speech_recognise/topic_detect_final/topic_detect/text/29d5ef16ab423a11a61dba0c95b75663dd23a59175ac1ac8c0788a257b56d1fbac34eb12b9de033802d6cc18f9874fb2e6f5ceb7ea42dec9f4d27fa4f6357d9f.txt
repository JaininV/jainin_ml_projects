As various countries continue to report high levels of invasive group A streptococcal (iGAS) infections — which cause severe illness, and in rare cases death within days — Canadian physicians are also raising alarms over a rise in serious cases this season.

The infections are linked to a common, often-harmless bacteria known as group A streptococcus. Usually it’s known for milder illnesses like strep throat or scarlet fever, which are typically treated with antibiotics.

But when bacteria enter the blood or deep tissue, people can develop more invasive, life-threatening conditions such as necrotizing fasciitis or toxic shock syndrome. In those dire cases, complications can involve massive damage to the skin and soft tissues, leading to amputations or even death, sometimes in as little as 12 to 24 hours after infection.

In Quebec, the number of iGAS infections recently spiked 56 per cent compared to the pre-pandemic average for the same time period, according to data collected by the province’s Ministry of Health and Social Services (MSSS).

A total of 327 cases were reported between the end of August 2022 and Feb. 11, 2023, compared to an average of 223 for the same period between 2015 and 2019, before widespread public health measures during the COVID-19 pandemic kept a variety of infectious diseases at bay.
