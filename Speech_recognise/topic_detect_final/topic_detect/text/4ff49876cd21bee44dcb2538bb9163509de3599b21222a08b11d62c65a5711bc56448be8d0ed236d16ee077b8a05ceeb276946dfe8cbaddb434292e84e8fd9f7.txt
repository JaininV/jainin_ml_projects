The newly released Genshin Impact 3.6 update has arrived with plethora of content to explore. Finally, the Dendro Archon is available to unlock as a playable character, as well as the next part of her Story Quest. These types of quests revolve around a story with the character in question and the Traveler. Nahida herself has two Acts available for her Story Quest, but how do you unlock these Genshin Impact quests? Continue reading to find out.

First off, it’s worth noting that Act One of her Story Quest was available before this update. But no matter which of Nahida’s Story Quests you’re attempting to unlock, you’ll need to face a few prerequisites first. When approaching Act One, like any Story Quest, you’ll need to spend a Story Key to unlock. You can get a Story Key by completing Daily Commissions, eight of them to be exact.

Unlocking this Story Quest also requires that you at least reach Adventure Rank 40. If you’ve already made it to Sumeru, you’ve probably already reached an Adventure Rank this high. Not only that, but you must complete the Archon Quest Chapter Three, Act Five, called ‘Akasha Pulses, the Kalpa Flame Rises’. This was a quest introduced in the 3.2 update, so if you’ve been an avid player for awhile, you’ve also probably completed this quest already. But if not, get to it!

Now, if you’ve already completed Act One of Nahida’s Story Quest and you want to unlock Act Two, it’s easy enough to do. That quest requires the same prerequisites, except for also having completed Act One of her Story Quest first. The Story Quests don’t take too long to complete, and they’re easy enough to unlock.
