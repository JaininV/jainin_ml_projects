I am blessed and favored

As I deep my feet in oil

I possess territories

As I deep my feet in oil

I shall live and not Die

As I deep my feet in Oil

every Yoke is broken

As I deep my feet in oil

I take authority

From east to west

From north to south

As I deep my feet in oil

I walk by faith and not by sight

call:-we are taking on territories

response:- Asher

call:-we are working in abundance

response:- Asher
