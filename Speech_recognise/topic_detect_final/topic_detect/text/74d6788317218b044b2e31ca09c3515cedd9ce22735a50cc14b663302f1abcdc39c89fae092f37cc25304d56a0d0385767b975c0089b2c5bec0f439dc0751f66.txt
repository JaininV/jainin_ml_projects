Imperial Pacific International (CNMI) LLC has asked the U. S. District Court for the NMI to vacate the $500,000 judgment that was previously granted in favor of U.S.A. Fanter Corp. Ltd., on the grounds of “extraordinary circumstances.”

IPI filed last Sunday a motion for relief from the final judgment in the defamation suit filed against them by USA Fanter.

District Court for the NMI Chief Judge Ramona Manglona previously ruled in favor of USA Fanter in the defamation lawsuit and awarded it a $500,000 judgment.

IPI now wants the court to relieve them from the judgment on the grounds of “extraordinary circumstances” due to the gross negligence and virtual abandonment by its legal counsel.

“Comes now, Imperial Pacific International (CNMI) LLC, by and through its counsels, hereby respectfully moves this court for an order vacating the judgment against IPI entered on March 20, 2023, based upon ‘extraordinary circumstances’ that justify such relief under federal rule of civil procedure,” IPI said.

According to Saipan Tribune archives, USA Fanter was awarded $500,000 in damages after the District Court for the NMI determined that two press releases IPI had issued to two CNMI newspapers defamed USA Fanter “of its reputation as a reputable construction contractor, having done business in the CNMI for over 30 years, and that defamation caused USA Fanter damage.”

USA Fanter was awarded $250,000 in general damages and $250,000 in punitive damages, for a total judgment amount of $500,000, plus post-judgment interest.

The 2019 press releases had accused USA Fanter of lying and inflating its fees.

USA Fanter is a former construction contractor of IPI.

Attorney Samuel I. Mok filed the lawsuit on behalf of USA Fanter while attorney Colin Murphy Thompson represented the plaintiff during the trial.
