About $1 million of the EDA funding will go toward a co-op program the state is announcing soon, which will allow convention and visitors' bureaus to apply for competitive matching grants to put toward increasing accessibility for travelers with disabilities.

Lorenz said the state has an opportunity again this year to bill itself as an option for "staycationers" as well as an affordable regional destination for travelers in surrounding states who dread the high cost of flying.

"So many people, they think they know Michigan, but the fact is, nobody's been going anywhere for three years," he said. "… We're going to really encourage people to get out there and really get to know their own state. … The other opportunity is, with these high costs, Michigan has always been a great value state for travel (for surrounding states). Things here cost less than they do in many other places."

He added that with international markets starting to reopen to airlines, Michigan can now re-enter the fray to compete for those travelers.

"Europeans, they can't wait to get here," he said. "We've continued our presence in our core markets, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, the U. K., Ireland, so we continued that all through COVID to some degree, and so we have all these relationships already. … What (those travelers) want right now more than ever, after what we've all gone through globally, they want to experience 'the real America' more than ever. That's what we are."
