AN EXTREMELY high level of activity is being experienced at the region’s two acute hospitals.

This is a situation which has continued since the four day Easter Holiday weekend, and which has meant services having to operate flexibly – making use of all available staffing capacity in order to meet demand.

A request is made for patients, families and Carers to be aware of this situation, and to understand that flexibility may be required from everyone to help manage the high level of activity.

Currently, unexpected staffing pressures at Galloway Community Hospital is impacting the Emergency Department service delivery. This may affect the patient pathway, meaning that some people in Wigtownshire who come forward needing help will be taken in the first instance to Dumfries and Galloway Royal Infirmary.

For this reason, and as is always the case, people requiring urgent medical help should first phone 999.

Anyone within the region requiring medical treatment should not hesitate to seek help.

For non life-threatening situations they are encouraged to consider excellent first points of help and advice which include the website www.nhsinform.scot and the NHS 24 helpline which is available by dialling 111.

Work is currently taking place to try and ensure that temporary contingency arrangements are in place for as short a time as possible, with the hope that these can be stood down after the weekend.
