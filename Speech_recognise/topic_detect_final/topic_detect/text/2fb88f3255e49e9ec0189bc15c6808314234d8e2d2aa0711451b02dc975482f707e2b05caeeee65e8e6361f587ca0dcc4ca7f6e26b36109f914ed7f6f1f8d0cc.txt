When I was 8 or 9, my mom hired an interior designer friend to do our house. We lived in a small town about an hour north of Toronto and I remember many (many!) trips to the city to look at tile, carpeting, lighting, drapes, hardware, etc etc. I liked lying on the floor in my bedroom poring over wallpaper books way more than being dragged from showroom to showroom 🙄 but I’m sure it’s what sparked my interest in interior design. And while I don’t have the budget to transform my own house from top to bottom, I love arranging and rearranging old and new pieces to keep things fresh. The design is in the details, as they say. So I’m delighted to share today’s fabulous find, the quarterly home decor subscription box by Toronto interior designer Valerie Iush. Here’s a look at the Spring VI Box. 😍😍

VI Box ships quarterly (March, June, September and December), sending a season-inspired mix of 6 to 9 sustainable items that are both beautiful and useful. All of the items are sourced from Canadian artisans and retailers.

The product guide is pretty and easy to read, but I’d love to see it elevated a bit to match the elegance and quality of the contents. A matte card stock would be lovely, and maybe a picture or two of the items in the box.

Introducing the special edition bread bag — a classic design with a charming striped pattern. Keep your bread fresh for longer and elevate your dining table with this versatile bag that doubles as a bread basket. Machine washable in cold water, simply hang to dry. Made from a blend of cotton and linen for durability and breathability.

I’ve seen these bags on Instagram and they are even lovelier in person ‘tho why whhhhhhy I didn’t take a pic of it standing up I don’t know 🤦‍♀️ but you can see one here. The colours fit right in with our dishes and tableware and oooh la la I’m gonna feel so French (so chic!) filling it with fresh pastries from our local boulangerie.

Add a touch of sophistication to your dining table with this fluted marble dish. Made from high-quality marble, this dish is perfect for serving appetizers, desserts, or even as a jewelry tray. The sleek design and durable material make it a versatile addition to any home.

This marble dish is one of my favourite new pieces and every time I see it those fluted edges leave me positively undone. (Ha ha okay maybe that’s a little dramatic but seriously! Don’t you just swoon? 😍😍) Right now I’ve got it on the kitchen counter because I love the contrast with the dark soapstone. And I like it empty (all the better to see that swoony fluting).

Light up your space with the flower candle, made from 100% natural soy wax. Enjoy the beautiful design and the subtle scent of this unique candle.

Shaped candles can make a mess when you light them so VI Box suggested a few precautions that I didn’t include here. This one feels too pretty to burn so I’m just going to enjoy it as-is, maybe even put it under a cloche so it doesn’t get dusty. I can’t smell any scent in particular. (When they say subtle, they mean it! 😂)

Crafted straight from nature, the olive wood mortar & pestle boasts unique natural shapes and slow-grown designs that add elegance to your prep work and make a statement when used to serve and display.

I bought my hubby one just like this years ago, only when my mom helped us move last summer she packed the mortar in one box and the pestle in the other and the two haven’t met since. (The pestle has to be somewhere!) Now we have a working set (yay!) and it fits right in with our decor. The olive wood is so nice. Olive the variety of materials in this box. 😉😂

The wooden dish brush is the perfect combination of durability and sustainability. The wood handle and replaceable sisal bristle head make it a long-lasting and eco-friendly option for cleaning dishes and tubs. The bristle are soft yet durable, making them ideal for scrubbing without causing any damage.

I’ve been wanting one of these brushes for ages and it works like a charm. Maybe VI Box could include one of the replaceable heads in a future box, or even in their shop? A bottle brush would be great to see too!

The honeycomb cotton throw is made from 100% long-staple cotton, which results in a stronger, softer, and more durable fabric. With its high-quality material, this throw is machine washable yet maintains its shape, softness and color. The textured pattern adds a cozy touch to your sofa or bed and is easy to combine with any decor style. Plus, it eliminates shedding and lint, ensuring that this cotton throw will last you for years to come.

And a throw! Wow! This one is light enough to use year-round (but not so light it won’t keep the chill off) and I love the durability. The pattern and the colour make me think of waffles more than honeycombs but then again it’s late and I’m getting hungry so maybe it’s just me. 🤷‍♀️

I think this is the third VI Box now and I hope it’s the third of many. I’m thrilled with the choice and quality of every item and the freshness they add to our decor. I can see us using them year-round, which is wonderful, and the variety of sustainable materials and textures is a tactile and visual treat. And all sourced from Canadian businesses! I don’t know of any other Canadian home decor subscription box but if this is the first, it’s definitely set the bar high.

The Spring VI Box Box is sold out but you can subscribe to receive the Summer edition and shop some great individual items they carry.

What do you think of this one? What would you like to see in the Summer VI Box?
