A report that a child had a gun at Clovis’ Yucca Middle School on Friday was determined to be unfounded, according to a police report obtained by The News.

Yucca Principal Annetta Hadley alerted police that one 11-year-old student reported another said he had a “Glock 19” in his pocket.

The student then reportedly said his dad owns “20 guns and a tank” at their house.

“After interviewing all children involved in the case, this report is unfounded and will be handled internally through the school. No children possessed a firearm on school property.”

The incident led the school to implement “secure and teach” protocols, continuing instruction while limiting building access as police investigated.

A third student was interviewed and told the police detective responding that both students made threats toward each other.

The parents of the student that made the first threat spoke to the detective, saying they had no idea why their child would make a statement like that. According to the report, the parents said they own firearms, but they are not accessible to their child.

The parents of the other two students that were interviewed were all present, records show.
