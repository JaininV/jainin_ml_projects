Man United lead the race to sign Monaco defender Axel Disasi this summer, sources have told Football Insider.

The Red Devils are in the market for a new centre-back and have turned their attention towards the 25-year-old after his impressive campaign in Ligue Un.

Chelsea and Man City have also registered interest in signing Disasi, but United are the favourites to sign him ahead of their Premier League rivals.

Erik ten Hag��s side have sent multiple scouts to watch Disasi at Monaco this season, and they have returned with positive reports on the French international.

United’s recruitment team view him as a star with huge potential and he has risen to become their first-choice defensive target this summer.

Harry Maguire, Victor Lindelof, Phil Jones and Eric Bailly all face uncertain futures at Old Trafford, and Ten Hag is keen to continue rebuilding his back line after adding Lisandro Martinez to the squad last summer.

Disasi is able to play either side of a centre-back partnership and has also shown his versatility this season by playing a handful of games at right-back.

He has made 41 appearances for Monaco this season, including every Ligue Un game so far, and contributed six goals and four assists in 2022/23.

Disasi has two years remaining on his Monaco contract, and the Ligue Un club are considering cashing in on him this summer before worries set in about losing him at a slashed price.
