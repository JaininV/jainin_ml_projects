Weddings celebrate love and the new milestone a couple is about to enter. The union of two people is a beautiful and remarkable moment most anticipated by their loved ones. Although two people are involved in the ceremony, the bride is considered the most important person that day. It’s rest assured that everyone follows the bride’s request and keeps her comfortable the whole event. Everyone is excited to see her, which also explains why the groom enters the venue first, and she is the grand finale.

Every bride adds their own twist to make their wedding ceremony unique from others. They want the event to be as memorable as it can be. Some sing while walking the aisle, while others wear a wedding gown in a striking color. For one bride from India, she makes an entrance while riding on a stunning white horse. All the guests were shocked by her grand entrance, and have also reached netizens across the world. Everything about the moment was gorgeous — from the bride’s glamorous pink lehenga with gold accents to the white horse adorned with accessories.

It was a twist that differs a lot from traditional love stories. Supposedly, the dashing prince or the groom should be riding horseback, but this time it was the beautiful bride. Her guests cheered for her and seemingly forgot that it was a wedding. Due to the grand entrance, it felt like they were welcoming a queen. You can see the amazement in the video uploaded on Instagram with the caption, “Why should boys have all the fun”. The Instagram reel was from shubhavivahh and has gone viral — earning 139k views and 3,548 likes. If you’re a bride hesitant to create a moment during weddings, then the video is a sign to shoot your shot. Shock everyone like the bride in the video below.
