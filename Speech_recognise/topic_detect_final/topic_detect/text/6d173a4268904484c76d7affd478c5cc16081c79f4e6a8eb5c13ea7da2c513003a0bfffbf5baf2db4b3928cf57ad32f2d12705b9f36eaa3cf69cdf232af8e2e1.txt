Burnley boss Vincent Kompany is believed to be ready to turn down any offer to become the next permanent Tottenham Hotspur manager in the summer.

Since retiring from the game in the summer of 2020, Kompany has gone on to forge an impressive managerial career.

The 37-year-old coached his former club Anderlecht before taking over at Burnley last summer. He has led the Championship club to promotion back to the Premier League already, and is now highly sought-after in the current market.

Kompany is widely believed to be one of the top names on the shortlist for the vacant managerial role at Tottenham (Daily Star).

According to the Daily Mail, Spurs chairman Daniel Levy is particularly keen on Kompany, but other board members have different ideas.

However, it is thought Chelsea are also looking at the former Manchester City man as a possible solution to their own managerial problems (The Times).

Now, the latest from sources at Football Insider suggest neither Spurs nor Chelsea will get their way, as Kompany is not intending to leave Burnley at the end of the season.

The report claims Kompany finds the interest from top clubs “flattering,” he remains “keen to take charge of Burnley in the top flight.”

A source close to the manager insisted it would be “unlikely” that Kompany will leave Burnley despite the interest from the two London clubs.

It won’t be easy for Burnley and Kompany next season in the Premier League, but why would he leave them just because bigger clubs have come calling?

At least with Burnley, he knows exactly what he’s in for and what the project requires.

Both Spurs and Chelsea are a total mess right now, and there are not many managers who would fancy the clean-up mission there.

A young manager could ruin their reputation by taking a job at these two clubs very easily.
