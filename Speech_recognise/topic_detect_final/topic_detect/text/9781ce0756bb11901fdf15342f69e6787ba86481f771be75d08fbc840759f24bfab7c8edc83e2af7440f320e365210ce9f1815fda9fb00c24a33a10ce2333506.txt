It was the monster hit felt by Justin Olam, and no doubt caused plenty of concern for every Queensland Origin hopeful.

Haumole Olakau’atu flattened Olam on Friday night with a bruising shot still being discussed in league land four days later.

Olakau’atu told the Herald he could not recall making a bigger tackle in his short career, and made a point of praising Manly teammate Josh Aloiai for causing just as much damage to the Storm centre.

Maroons legend Johnathan Thurston said during TV commentary on the night, “I’m glad I’m retired”, while former enforcer Willie Mason labelled the tackle “one of the best hits I’ve seen” on social media.
