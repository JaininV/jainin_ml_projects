Fix line numbers after inlined type checks ( gh #42 ). Previously, the code for type checks was inlined literally, so if a particular check took 5 lines of code, all the following line numbers in the source file would be off by 5 (they would be "pushed down" by the interpolated code). These bad line numbers would show up in error messages from Perl (including warn and die) as well as __LINE__ and caller (and thus stack traces).

To install Function::Parameters, copy and paste the appropriate command in to your terminal.

cpanm Function::Parameters

perl -MCPAN -e shell

install Function::Parameters
