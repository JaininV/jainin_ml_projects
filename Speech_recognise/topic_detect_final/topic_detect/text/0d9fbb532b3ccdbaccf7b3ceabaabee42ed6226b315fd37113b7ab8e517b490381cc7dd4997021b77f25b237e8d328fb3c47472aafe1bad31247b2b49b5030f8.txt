I love this idea for a prompt! Here are ten recent (or recent-ish) shows that Iâ€™ve enjoyed. I usually only watch two or three of them each week, so sometimes it takes me a few years or even longer to start watching what many other folks finished ages ago.

1. The Last of Us

9. The Man in the High Castle

As you can see, I like to jump around between genres. Have you seen any of these shows?
