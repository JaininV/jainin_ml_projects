MIAMI, April  19, 2023  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- International Money Express, Inc. (NASDAQ: IMXI), ("Intermex" or the "Company"), a leading money remittance services company, today announced the Company has amended its revolving credit facility under its syndicated credit agreement with KeyBank National Association as administrative agent to increase the maximum borrowing amount to $220 million, up from $150 million.

Loans under the amended revolving credit facility, maturing in 2026, are under the same terms and bear the same interest rates as prior to the amendment.

In conjunction with the increased revolver capacity, the amendment also provides the Company with an additional $70 million uncommitted incremental capacity, which may be utilized in the future for additional term or revolving loans.

"The upsized revolver and additional $70 million uncommitted feature further enhance the financial flexibility of the Company, providing more room to grow organically and through M&A, and allow us to continue to be opportunistic with share buybacks,” said Andras Bende, Chief Financial Officer.
