One of the thousands of Greeks who chose to celebrate Easter in Corfu this year is the president of SYRIZA, Alexis Tsipras, who visited the Ionian island after completing his tour in Kefalonia.

After watching the procession of the epitaphios in the village of Benitses yesterday, Tsipras attended today the procession of the epitaph of Saint Spyridon, which according to tradition in Corfu takes place on Holy Saturday morning, before the first Resurrection.

Afterwards, he followed the custom of the Botides, breaking a jug himself from the balcony he had climbed, while his two sons did the same.

After the first Resurrection, the ringing of the bell gave the signal. Countless pitchers of water fell from windows and balconies to clatter.

The pitchers were mainly painted red but also decorated with representations. The windows of the houses were decorated with red flags a custom that lends solemnity to the day. Immediately after, the city's philharmonics created a festive atmosphere with joyful marches.

At the time of breaking the vases in the heart of the old city, the custom of Mastela was revived. The custom that comes from time immemorial has a symbolic character. It sends the message of supporting those in need, because those who were diving into the barrel were the porters of the city.

From Holy Monday, a wooden barrel decorated with laurels and filled with water is placed. The faithful throw in coins and make wishes. With the first Resurrection, whoever dives in, is the one who will get the money.
