It’s officially spring and Millie Bobby Brown's proposal is just extra proof love is in the air in Hollywood. In early February, Vanessa Hudgens shared the news of her engagement to Cole Tucker and our eyes were locked on her blood-red stiletto nails, an atypical colour for an engagement manicure. Now, Millie is the latest to jump on the engagement train and we can't get enough of her metallic manicure when she made the announcement.

On 11 April, Brown shared the news via Instagram with a photo of fiancé Jake Bongiovi embracing her for her 60 million and counting followers to see. “I've loved you three summers now, honey, I want 'em all,” the caption reads. Though the photo is grayscale, her metallic mani can be clearly seen with nails filed into a long, almond shape.

It seems that Brown tried out the glazed donut manicure trend, which was initially made popular by Hailey Bieber. But it's hard to tell whether Brown went for the classic white or chose a brighter colour for the iridescent manicure.

Many folks want to be wearing the perfect manicure the moment their partner pops the question, which is easier said than done if you don't know when they will propose. Once upon a time, engagement manicures usually involved a French tip or neutral hue, but people are breaking away from tradition with a wider range of colours and designs.

We're sure that it was just a perfect coincidence that Millie Bobby Brown had these cute, glazed donut nails when she became a fiancée. Congrats on your engagement, guys!
