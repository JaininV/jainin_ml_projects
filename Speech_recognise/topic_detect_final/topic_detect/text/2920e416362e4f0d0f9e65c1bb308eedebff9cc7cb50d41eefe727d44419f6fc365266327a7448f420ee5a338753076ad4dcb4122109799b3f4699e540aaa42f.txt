A popular place to take photos and explore has been closed off at the Universal Orlando Resort unexpectedly.

The Universal Orlando Resort is home to so many incredible rides, attractions, and experiences that will have you asking when your next trip is. From Universal Studios Florida to Universal Islands of Adventure, Guests are in for a wild time no matter which Park they choose to visit. And Guests shouldn’t forget Universal CityWalk, a giant shopping a dining district similar to Disney Springs at Walt Disney World.

However, as Universal Orlando is a theme park, that means rides and attractions closures are always a possibility. Attractions need downtime, whether it’s to allow Universal to fix them or refurbish them.

Recently, we noticed an area is now boarded off completely to Guests.

At Universal Islands of Adventure, Guests will find Marvel Superhero Island. The architecture and theming of Marvel Superhero Island are like a comic book that came to life. Guests will find all sorts of classic Marvel characters throughout the land. Unfortunately, part of this area is now boarded up, as you can see below:

The Marvel Metero Shards installation is now completely off-limits to Guests visiting Superhero Island. The sign on the construction walls indicates this attraction is being refurbished in some way, though we are not entirely sure how.

In other news, Universal is currently constructing Epic Universe, its newest theme park. Epic Universe will serve as Universal Orlando’s “third gate” and contain some incredible rides and attractions. Epic Universe will also feature its own version of SUPER NINTENDO WORLD, a land that was previously only offered at Universal Studios Japan and Universal Studios Hollywood.
