Paul Simon has announced his first new album since 2018’s In the Blue Light. Seven Psalms is out May 19 (via Owl Records/Legacy Recordings). The album is a 33-minute, seven-movement collection intended to be heard—according to the announcement—as one continuous piece.

The below video offers a brief behind-the-scenes look at the album’s creation. Simon reveals that the album’s concept came to him in a dream. The album features a guest appearance from Edie Brickell and the British vocal ensemble Voces8. Simon produced the album with Kyle Crusham. The video ends by noting that it was a trailer of sorts for an upcoming documentary about the album’s creation called In Restless Dreams, directed by documentarian Alex Gibney.
