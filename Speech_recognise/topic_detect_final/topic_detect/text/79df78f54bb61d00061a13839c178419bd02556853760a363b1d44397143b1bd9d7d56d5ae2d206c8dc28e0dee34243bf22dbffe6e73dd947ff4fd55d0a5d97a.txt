With the WWE Draft fast approaching, there’s still no sign of Bray Wyatt. The Eater of the World made his menacing return last year at Extreme Rules. The Former Universal Champion also brought Uncle Howdy into the fold. However, Wyatt was written off WWE TV unceremoniously after his first match since his return at the Royal Rumble. According to a new report, Wyatt’s return is unlikely to take place in the foreseeable future.

After defeating LA Knight in a never seen before “Pitch Black match”, Wyatt set his sights on Bobby Lashley. It appeared as if the New Face of Fear was headed to WrestleMania to face the Almighty, but the match never materialized due to a fly in the ointment. According to multiple reports, Wyatt could be dealing with a health issue.

Xero News reports that Bray Wyatt’s return may take longer than expected. Wyatt has seemingly been “pulled from internal run sheets”. While WWE fans expected the 35-year-old to make his comeback during the upcoming WWE Draft, it turns out, we will have to forgo his return.

The report also notes that there will be no mention of Bray Wyatt during the WWE Draft. The WWE Draft will be a two-night affair, taking place on April 28 on SmackDown and May 1 on Raw.

Wyatt’s status is being treated as a top-secret backstage. His return is taking longer as the promotion is reportedly looking to avoid any further complications in the future relating to his health.

Bray Wyatt is still far off a return & has been pulled from internal runsheets. Possibly won’t even be mentioned at the draft at all. Health issues, they are looking into it to avoid complications in the future, but no timetable for his return as it stands #BWE & A source.

Wyatt’s absence affected WWE’s plans for Bobby Lashley at WrestleMania 39. Lashley turned out to be one of the few superstars who had to sit WrestleMania 39 out. The Andre the Giant Memorial Battle Royal winner, however, did make an appearance during the show.

Bray Wyatt’s return may have majorly flopped, but fans are still clamoring to see the multi-time World Champion return to the squared circle. Wyatt is one of WWE’s best merch sellers. The Eater of the World, once, dethroned Roman Reigns as the top merch seller in October 2022.

In addition, Wyatt’s iconic spot with The Undertaker at Raw XXX gave the fans the impression of the passing of the torch. With The Undertaker retired, Wyatt is the sole supernatural gimmick that WWE has.
