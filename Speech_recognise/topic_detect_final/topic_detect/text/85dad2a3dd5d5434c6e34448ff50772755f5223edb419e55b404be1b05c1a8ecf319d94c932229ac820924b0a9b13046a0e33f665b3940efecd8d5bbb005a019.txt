The Saskatchewan Roughriders have signed Canadian receiver Kian Schaffer-Baker to a two-year contract extension that will keep him with the club through the 2025 season.

The six-foot-four, 205-pound pass catcher is coming off a season that saw him set career highs in catches, yards and touchdowns when he snagged 68 balls for 960 yards and five scores. The 24-year-old also finished the season with 412 yards after catch, good for 11th in the league and second among Canadian pass catchers. He also ran the ball 13 times for 74 yards and was the team’s Most Outstanding Rookie in 2021 and Most Outstanding Canadian in 2022.

Schaffer-Baker was selected by the Roughriders in the fourth round, 30th overall, in the 2020 CFL Draft and first drew into the line-up in Week 3 of the 2021 season. He played all 12 of the remaining regular season games that season and made 45 receptions for 550 yards and two touchdowns. He added another 43 yards and one touchdown in the post-season.

The Mississauga, Ontario native spent four collegiate seasons at the University of Guelph. He played 28 games with the Gryphons, recording 95 receptions for 1,544 yards and eight touchdowns. He impressed at the 2019 East-West Bowl where he led all receivers with five catches for 126 yards and a touchdown.

Schaffer-Baker underwent hip surgery and is not expected to be ready for the start of the 2023 season, Riders’ general manager Jeremy O’Day recently told 3DownNation.

The young Canadian star failed to land an NFL contract this winter after working out with several teams during CFL’s NFL tryout window.
