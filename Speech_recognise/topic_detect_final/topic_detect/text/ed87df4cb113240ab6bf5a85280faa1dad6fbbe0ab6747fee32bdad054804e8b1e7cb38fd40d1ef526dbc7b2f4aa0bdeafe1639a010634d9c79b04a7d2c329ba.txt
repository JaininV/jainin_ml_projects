Working With C4D’s New Symmetry Object to Create Abstract Animations

Effectatron shows some new features in C4D 2023.2 and the new Symmetry Object for creating kaleidoscope effects.

Derek Kirk (Effectatron) shows some of the new settings in symmetry, especially in the latest Maxon Cinema 4D 2023.2. The tutorial shows how to use the new symmetry object to create kaleidoscopic loops and also walks through creating grainy-looking gradients with Redshift Renderer in Cinema 4D.

Also, check out this other tutorial from Kirk that shows how to work with the new cloth features in C4D to create pretty abstract images with Redshift.
