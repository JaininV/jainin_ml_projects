Soon it will be “Summer in the City,” and elsewhere.  In an Order published today, Chief Justice Rabner announced the lineup and dates for summer Parts of the Appellate Division.  As was the case for the first time last summer, this coming “summer,” which for this purpose runs from June 19 through September 10, encompasses groups of four Appellate Division judges (except for the first stint, covering June 19 through July 2, which has only three judges, one of whom is Judge  Messano, whose mandatory retirement date is May 23) sitting for two-week terms.  No judge is scheduled for more than one such summer term.
