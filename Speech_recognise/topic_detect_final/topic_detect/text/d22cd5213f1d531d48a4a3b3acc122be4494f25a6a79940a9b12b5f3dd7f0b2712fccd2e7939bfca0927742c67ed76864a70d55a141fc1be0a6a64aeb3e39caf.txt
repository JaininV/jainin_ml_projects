One for the road.

But just one?

Fernando Tatis Jr. led off Triple-A El Paso’s 10-3 loss on Sunday with yet another home run, giving him seven in a torrid eight-game rehab assignment with the Chihuahuas ahead of Thursday’s return from his PED suspension.

The 24-year-old Tatis also singled as the DH in a 2-for-5 afternoon at Southwest University Park, pushing his batting line to .515/.590/1.212 over 39 plate appearances. He drove in 15 runs, walked six times against three strikeouts and stole two bases.

His power stroke has been especially on point.

Tatis homered three times Thursday, twice Saturday and once Sunday. He is expected to rejoin the Padres on Monday and could get at-bats on Tuesday, in either simulated action at Petco Park or at low Single-A Lake Elsinore.

Adam Engel also continued his rehab assignment, going 1-for-2 with a double and two walks while playing seven innings in center field.

Third baseman Yorman Rodriguez (1.031 OPS) went 3-for-4 with a run scored.

Knuckle-baller Matt Waldron (0-2, 11.93 ERA) allowed six runs—five earned—in seven innings in 4 2/3 innings in the loss.

* Frisco 12, Missions 2: RHP Efrain Contreras (0-3, 11.12) allowed four runs — two earned — on two walks and three hits in an inning in the start. RHP Kevin Kopps (6.35) walked three and allowed a run in 1 2/3 innings in relief. CF Korry Howell (.576 OPS) went 1-for-4 with a double and a run scored. RF Tirso Ornelas (.787 OPS) went 0-for-3 with three strikeouts and an RBI.

* TinCaps 9, Lake County 1: 3B Marcos Castanon (.752 OPS) hit his first homer, doubled and drove in three runs. SS Jackson Merrill doubled twice and scored two runs. 2B Lucas Dunn (.875 OPS) and DH Carlos Luis (.917 OPS) both drove in two runs on two hits. RHP Ryan Bergert (1.80) struck out four over three shutout innings. RHP Nick Thwaits (1-0, 3.38) earned the win with three strikeouts over three shutout innings in relief.
