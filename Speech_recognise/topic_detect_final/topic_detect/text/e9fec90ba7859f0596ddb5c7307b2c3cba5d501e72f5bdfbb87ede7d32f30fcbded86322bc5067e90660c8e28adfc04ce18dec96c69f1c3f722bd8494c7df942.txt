Barbados and CARICOM have been advised the time has come for a comprehensive review of the region’s education and school systems.

To support his call, Dominica’s prime minister, Roosevelt Skerrit says the current systems are focused solely on preparing children for examinations.

He believes such a review will help address the crime and violence situation.
