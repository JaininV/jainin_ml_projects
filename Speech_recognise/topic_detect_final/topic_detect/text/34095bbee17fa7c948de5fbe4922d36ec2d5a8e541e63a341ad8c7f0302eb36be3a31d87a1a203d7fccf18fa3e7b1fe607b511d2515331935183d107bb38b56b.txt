If the Spice Girls needed a sixth member, we found her. ðŸ‘€ Addison Rae has been busy filming the horror movie Thanksgiving with Eli Roth, Milo Manheim, Patrick Dempsey, and more, but the TikTok star and social media darling has been living her best (fashion) life when she's off-duty.

Let's first take a little walk down memory lane because Addison's recent style has been too good to ignore. She embraced the Y2K lace-up trend with a seaside mini skirt, explored Japan in a skintight lime green gown, and looked like a modern Marilyn Monroe in a white halter dress that she wore â€” twice. Addison even served businesswoman chic in an archival Thierry Mugler look.

Thankfully, the fashion inspo just keeps coming. We did a double-take @ her most recent IG post where Addy's outfit makes her look like a true '90s pop star. The He's All That actress puckered her lips for the camera in a backless silky red halter top paired with classic blue jeans. She wore large silver hoop earrings for major retro vibes and appeared to be sporting colorful eyeshadow.

In the third slide of her photo dump, Addison rocked another throwback trendâ€” low-rise jeans. ðŸ˜³ She wore a glitzy gold tank top with medium-rinse jeans slung across her hips and a trucker hat for max Y2K vibes. Another photo showed a sign that read "SOLUNA LOVES THANKSGIVING" (presumably at a restaurant or venue that the Thanksgiving cast visited).

"Winning isnâ€™t everything. Itâ€™s the only thing," she cryptically captioned her post.

"Youâ€™re written in the same font as brook [sic] shields," complimented a fan. "Mother served so hard i fainted," emphasized another.

BRB, adding this picture of Addison to our style mood boards. If you're dying to figure out where her top is from (or find some affordable dupes), we've rounded up some pieces to help you recreate Addy's '90s girl group look this spring.  Happy shopping!
