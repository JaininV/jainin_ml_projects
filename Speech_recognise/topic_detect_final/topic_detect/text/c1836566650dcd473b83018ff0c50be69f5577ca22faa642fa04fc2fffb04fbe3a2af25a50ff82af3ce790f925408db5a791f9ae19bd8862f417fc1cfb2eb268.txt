(ANSA) - ROME, APR 18 - One of the suspected smugglers implicated in the February 26 migrant boat tragedy that left 94 people confirmed dead is not a minor as originally thought, judicial sources said on Tuesday.

The prosecutor at the juvenile court in Catanzaro said during a pre-trial hearing that police in Crotone had produced documentation showing that the suspect, initially believed to be 17, is actually aged between 21 and 22 years old.

On the basis of this documentation the preliminary investigation judge declared incompetence and transferred jurisdiction to the ordinary tribunal in Crotone, where the prosecution of three adult suspected smugglers is already underway.

The defense expressed surprise at the development, but said that in procedural terms "nothing changes".

The next hearing in Crotone is scheduled for April 26.

On Monday a survivor told judges at a pre-trial hearing in Crotone that the smugglers captaining the boat carrying around 180 refugees and migrants from Turkey that ran aground off Cutro in Italy's southern Calabria region in rough seas had filmed promotional videos during the sea crossing.

80 people survived the shipwreck.

Questions have been asked as to why the Italian coast guard failed to go out and assist the boat, which has been spotted by a Frontex plane but not flagged as being at risk.

The Italian government has denied suggestions there was any deliberate delay, and passed a decree at Cutro last month to clamp down on migrant smugglers and boost legal pathways to Italy.

The decree, with amendments, is currently before parliament for conversion into law. (ANSA).
