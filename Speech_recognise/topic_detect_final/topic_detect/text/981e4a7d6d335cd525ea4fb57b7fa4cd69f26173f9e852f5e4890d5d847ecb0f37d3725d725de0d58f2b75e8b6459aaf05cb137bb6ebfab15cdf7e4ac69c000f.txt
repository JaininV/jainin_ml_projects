Did anyone else do Upper Deck National Hockey Card Day on Saturday? They were giving out free cards at LCSs. I tried Walmart, Target, and GameStop, but they didn't know what I was talking about. So I figured I would try to complete the 31 card set.

I have these extras to trade: #3(x3),8(x2),14(x2),18(x2),25,28,29(x2),31(x4) Rookie Moments Matty Beniers #NHCD-BE

I collect Aaron Rowand, Bears and White Sox GU, autos or cool cards.

I am trying to complete some sets too. Especially for 2002 flair football and 2015 Allen and Ginter Baseball. PM me for fastest results and in case I forgot.
