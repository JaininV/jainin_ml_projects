What is Betbazar expecting from the upcoming Prague Gaming & TECH Summit?

The team at SolutionsHub are thrilled to announce their double nomination for the esteemed EGR B2B Awards 2023 in the categories of Corporate Services Supplier and Cryptocurrency Services Supplier. The highly anticipated awards ceremony will take place on June 8 at The Roundhouse in London.

The team at SolutionsHub seeks to build upon their past victories, having won the Cryptocurrency Services Supplier awards in both 2019 and 2022.

The EGR B2B Awards recognize and honor the very best service providers in the online gaming industry, celebrating the achievements of suppliers from all major egaming disciplines, including betting and gaming software, payments, recruitment, safer gambling tools, IT, infrastructure, and more.

This year’s nominees list features industry powerhouses such as Aspire Global, Pinnacle, and SOFTSWISS.

Lee Hills, CEO of SolutionsHub, expressed immense pride in the team’s double nomination, stating: “The EGR B2B Awards showcase the companies that power the egaming industry. They represent the pinnacle of achievement in the gambling sector, and being nominated for one award is already a significant accomplishment, let alone two. This recognition validates the expertise, dedication, and talent of our exceptional team.”

He added, “We’re delighted to be acknowledged once again for our cryptocurrency-related expertise, as it’s a highly specialized field where we have consistently been at the forefront.”

Hills also emphasized the Isle of Man’s role in driving global trends in crypto, blockchain, and egaming. He highlighted the island’s FinTech Innovation Challenge as an example of the Isle of Man’s forward thinking approach.

The Innovation Challenge is a collaboration between Digital Isle of Man, Finance Isle of Man, and supported by the Financial Services Authority, and Deloitte. It seeks to drive a thriving, sustainable future for the Isle of Man by giving innovative businesses around the world the chance to experience the island’s collaborative financial service sector and showcase their solutions to core challenges that have been identified across the Isle of Man business community.

Hills is a Buddy Mentor for Critical Compliance, a finalist in the wildcard category, who’s proprietary technology enhances the egaming industry’s ability to meet the growing and diverse demands of responsible gambling, by supporting companies and regulators to build sustainable, effective, and responsible gaming models.

The EGR B2B Awards 2023 nominations further cement the Isle of Man’s position as a center for innovative industry developments. As the SolutionsHub team eagerly awaits the ceremony, they remain optimistic about their chances against strong competition, aiming to secure another award to add to their 2019 and 2022 successes.

Independent slots studio Thunderkick is inviting players to bounce into action with Jiggly Cash, a high-volatility slot where a bubbly adventure awaits.

Featuring impressive world-building, several different mechanics and an engaging design, the 6×5 slot is the latest addition to Thunderkick’s renowned portfolio, sitting alongside popular titles including Midas Golden Touch and new releases such as The Wildos.

Jiggly Cash is set in the colourful Jiggly-kingdom, where players are tasked with helping the Jigglys in their pursuit for the golden riches. Aided by plenty of exciting features including Avalanche wins, Mystery symbols and a thrilling Bonus round, this slot offers up plenty of big winning potential.

In the base game, the Jigglys can be found upon the reels alongside symbols such as stars, hearts and moons. Landing eight or more identical symbols on any spin except Bonus, Multiplier and Mystery symbols constitutes a Scatter pay win.

Seeing the return of the Avalanche feature, the innovative addition to the studio’s bouncy slot is triggered after each Scatter win, where players will see winning symbols removed from the reels and replaced with new symbols that drop from above. The Avalanche continues so long as there is a new win, with wins being accumulated until it ends.

When three or more Scatter symbols land during the base game, the bonus will be triggered, awarding 10 Free Spins and opening the Jigglybank.

All activated multiplier values during the Bonus are also added together and stored here, being applied at the end of an Avalanche for huge winning potential of up to 10,000x the player’s bet.

Commenting on the launch, Gary Law, Product Owner at Thunderkick, said: “We’re excited to be launching Jiggly Cash, another fantastic addition to our portfolio with an immersive theme and plenty of winning potential.

“Players are going to have a blast with the thrill of Mystery symbols and the Avalanche feature, plus the chance to take home 10,000x their bet in the Bonus round. We can’t wait to see what they think.”
