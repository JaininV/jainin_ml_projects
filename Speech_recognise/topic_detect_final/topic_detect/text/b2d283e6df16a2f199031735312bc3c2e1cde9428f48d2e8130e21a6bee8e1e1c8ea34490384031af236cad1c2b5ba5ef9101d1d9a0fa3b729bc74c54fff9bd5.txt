The debate was sparked by a Facebook post from Mercedes Johnson, a freelance recruiter who thought she was making a strong point about salary negotiations. Unfortunately, the rest of the internet did not agree.

“I offered her that because that’s what she asked for and I personally don’t have the bandwidth to give lessons on salary negotiation,” Johnson said. “ALWAYS ASK FOR THE SALARY YOU WANT (DESERVE), no matter how large you think it might be…#beconfident.”

Of course, Johnson’s post was quickly screenshotted and shared on other social media platforms, including Twitter, where things got heated. Many people believed the blame shouldn’t be placed on the job seeker, as it’s the responsibility of a good recruiter to help a candidate who’s selling themself short.

“My niece was offered a tech job. No experience. The panel asked what were her salary requirements. My niece, 23, had no clue & underbid herself. THE BLACK LADY on the panel disconnected the live “accidentally,” called my niece’s cell phone n told her what to ask for,” the tweet read.

“It doesn’t feel good and this should have gone differently,” she wrote. “She deserves to be paid what she’s worth from the company despite what she thinks the job responsibilities are worth,” she said.

“Everybody is not going to agree with the things that were said in that post, but I believe that the post did 100% of what it was supposed to do,” she told HuffPost. “I’m confident that the over two million people that saw my post will now negotiate properly in the interview process.”
