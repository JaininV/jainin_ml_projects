(ANSA) - ROME, APR 18 - Italian retailers association Confcommercio said Tuesday that Italy's GDP will still be behind the level of 2007 next year, as it presented its growth forecasts for 2023 and 2024.

It said it expects gross domestic product to rise 0.9% this year, compared to the government's forecast of 1% in its DEF economic blueprint, and 1.2% in 2024, when the executive sees the economy growing by 1.5%.

As a result, it said, Italy's per-capita GDP will still be 145 euros below the level of 2007 at the end of 2024. (ANSA).
