The Golden Nugget in Lake Charles is known for its legendary concerts here in Southwest Louisiana and now they are getting recognized for the venue and shows. The Golden Nugget not only has great concerts from other genres of music but they also have a ton of country music concerts inside the Grand Event Center.

That is why the Golden Nugget in Lake Charles has been nominated for an Academy Of Country Music Award aka the ACM. They have been nominated for the Casino of The Year-Theatre ACM.

One of the reasons they were nominated was because of the amount of great country talent they bring to our area. Coming up they have Diamond Rio, Mark Chesnutt, Carly Pearce, Tanya Tucker, Pat Green, Ronnie Milsap, Gary LaVox of Rascal Flatts, Chris Cagle, and Lainey Wilson all on the calendar for this year so far.

That is a heck of a lineup so no wonder they were nominated for an ACM. The Golden Nugget Lake Charles posted on their Facebook page,

We are so honored to announce that we have been nominated for Casino of the Year-Theatre for the 58th Academy of Country Music Awards! Thank you ACM - Academy of Country Music for this exciting recognition! #ACMawards#GoldenNuggetLC
