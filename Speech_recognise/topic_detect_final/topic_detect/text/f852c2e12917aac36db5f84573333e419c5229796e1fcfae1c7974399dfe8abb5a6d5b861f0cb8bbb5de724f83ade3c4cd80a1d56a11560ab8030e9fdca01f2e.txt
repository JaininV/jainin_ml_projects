“I think I could do the job,” Sununu quickly responded.

The New Hampshire Republican has teased a run numerous times, appearing on cable shows in recent weeks and speaking at the annual National Rifle Association conference in Indianapolis last week. In February, he formed the “Live Free or Die” fundraising committee, a move viewed as Sununu testing the presidential waters.

Harlow noted that Sununu’s comment is the closest he has come yet to declaring a run, to which he responded: “I’m looking at it … it’s a big decision for the family, for the process, for the party.”

“Why not just say it?” Lemon asked, pointing to the various cameras in the newsroom.

“Literally my wife is texting me right now as we’re speaking, [saying] what is going on? Look, we’ll have the whole discussion,” Sununu said. “I think there’s hope, I really think there’s opportunity, and if it’s a Chris Sununu way, or some other candidate to bring it to the table, that’s a win for America.”

Earlier in the interview, Sununu emphasized his difference to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, another likely GOP presidential contender, on abortion: “We in New Hampshire have a 24 week ban, or 24 weeks of choice … that seems to be where most of America is.” DeSantis, on the other hand, last week signed a bill to ban abortion after six weeks of pregnancy.

He also criticized former President Donald Trump’s leadership while in office, saying that he got “very little done, didn’t drain the swamp like he promised, didn’t provide border security like he promised.”
