To determine the 2023 Vincentric Best Fleet Value in America Awards, Vincentric performed a cost of ownership analysis measuring over 2,000 vehicle configurations based on typical fleet use.

Using eight different cost factors - depreciation, fees & taxes, financing, fuel, insurance, maintenance, opportunity cost, and repairs - each vehicle was evaluated in all 50 states plus D. C. using 28 different lifecycle scenarios.

Winners were identified by determining which vehicles had the lowest fleet lifecycle cost in most scenarios within its segment.
