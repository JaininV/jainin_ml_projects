King Charles III and queen consort Camilla have chosen a "Coronation Quiche" for the upcoming coronation ceremony, Buckingham Palace has announced.

The dish, featuring spinach, broad beans and tarragon, is a nod to Coronation Chicken, a curry and mayonnaise-based dish invented for the 1953 coronation of Queen Elizabeth II.

The palace said on its website the dish had been chosen personally by the king and his wife and was "easily adapted to different tastes and preferences."

It has been presented as a recipe for hundreds of community lunches planned across Britain to mark the May 6 event.

King Charles will be crowned at London's Westminster Abbey in a ceremony resplendent with pomp and pageantry, with traditions dating back 1,000 years.

The event will be attended by foreign heads of state and dignitaries.

"A deep quiche with a crisp, light pastry case and delicate flavours of spinach, broad beans and fresh tarragon," said the recipe on the royal family's website, which accompanied a video clip featuring a royal chef preparing the dish.

"Eat hot or cold with a green salad and boiled new potatoes."

The palace has been slowly releasing details of the coronation, which is set to be smaller in its scale than that of Queen Elizabeth, partly reflecting the modern age and the cost-of-living crisis.
