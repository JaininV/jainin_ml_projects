Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla twitted suspended Negros Oriental Representative Arnolfo “Arnie” Teves for saying he found it funny to be tagged as a terrorist so he can be flushed out of hiding.

Remulla said there is nothing funny about the assassination of Negros Oriental Governor Roel Degamo and eight others on 4 March while the latter was distributing aid to the beneficiaries of 4Ps in his residence.

“There is nothing funny about nine people getting killed,” Remulla told the media in a message. “The people are/were terrorized and are/were living in fear as long as he is not in legal custody. We are guarding against that capability to wreak havoc and destruction to people’s lives.”

Remulla said Monday the Department of Justice will seek to designate and proscribe Teves as a terrorist to force him to surrender to authorities.

On 4 March, Degamo and eight others were killed while several others were injured after an attack at the governor’s home in Negros Oriental while he was distributing aid to his constituents.

“That is not funny at all, considering that the

highest-ranked local official was killed in his own home while serving his constituents, by highly trained gunmen recruited for that purpose. Was what happened to Gov. Degamo funny in any way?” he said.

Teves vehemently denied his involvement in the killing of Degamo and that he will return to the Philippines when he feels it is safe to do so despite the assurance of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. that he will be provided security from the time he lands at the airport to his residence.
