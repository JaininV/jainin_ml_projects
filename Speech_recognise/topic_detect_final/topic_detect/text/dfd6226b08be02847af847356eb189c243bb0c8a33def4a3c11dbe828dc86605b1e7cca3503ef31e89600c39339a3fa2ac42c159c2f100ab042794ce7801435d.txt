A local author will be talking about her latest book at an event tomorrow at the South Butler Library.

Julie Tulba will be discussing “Red Clay Ashes” which is a brand-new novel about the Vietnam War that’s partially set in Butler.

She will also chat about her extensive travel experiences, which have taken her to more than 30 countries in five different continents. That includes a trip to Vietnam in 2020 that served as inspiration for her latest novel.

The event is free and no registration is required. It begins at 6:30 p.m.
