Video game-related content is huge these days, from YouTube to Twitch and beyond. But traditional television struggled for literally decades to figure out how to build shows around video games and gaming culture, with nothing ever really sticking. Among the earliest attempts to represent video games on television was "Starcade!," which ran for just two years in the early '80s and featured kids answering trivia questions about video games before actually playing games in subsequent rounds.

This format was loosely borrowed for the innovative game show "Nickelodeon Arcade," which aired for two seasons. Like "Starcade!," kids answered questions and solved puzzles about video games, but the game-playing portions were much more ambitious. Contestants would start each episode by competing in a video game that was built from the ground up specifically for the show, though most of the games were just variations on "Pong." The main event of the show, though, was when kids got to "enter" a video game in the final round.

Of course, a lot of this took place in 1992, so the tech was pretty primitive and basically just kids running around in front of green screens. Still, it was a neat trick that looked cool for the audience at home, and really set "Nick Arcade" apart from its peers.
