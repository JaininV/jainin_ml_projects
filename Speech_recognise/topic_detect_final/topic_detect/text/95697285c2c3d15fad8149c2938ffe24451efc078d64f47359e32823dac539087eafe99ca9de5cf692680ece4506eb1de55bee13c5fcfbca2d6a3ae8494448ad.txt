Great Wall Motor’s army of Tank SUVs continues to expand, with another model revealed at this week’s Shanghai motor show.

The plug-in hybrid Tank 400 wears similar angular styling to the previously revealed Tank 700, but is closer to the Tank 300 in size – which may make an Australian launch a non-starter.

“We’ve already confirmed Tank 300 and Tank 500 is firming as the second Tank model for Australia,” said a spokesperson for GWM Haval Australia.

“These two models would provide coverage of the medium and large SUV segments. With that in mind Tank 400 is, at this stage, not on the cards for Australia but never say never…”

According to reports in Chinese media, it measures 4985mm long, 1960mm wide and 1905mm tall on a 2850mm wheelbase. That slots it between the Tank 300 (4760mm long on a 2750mm wheelbase) and the Tank 500 (5070mm long on a 2850mm wheelbase).

Badging reveals it uses the company’s new Hi4 plug-in hybrid all-wheel drive system, and it reportedly features a 2.0-litre turbocharged four-cylinder engine mated with two electric motors and a three-speed Direct Hybrid Transmission.

Total system outputs are reportedly 300kW of power and 750Nm of torque.

The aggressive styling includes flared wheel arches with exposed bolts, for a rugged look. There also appears to be plenty of ground clearance, though no official figure is available yet.

As with other Tank models, the spare wheel is mounted externally on the tailgate.

Though it has a large touchscreen, GWM hasn’t abandoned physical switchgear entirely. There’s a row of it on the centre stack, including physical climate controls, plus additional buttons on the centre console.

Sitting ahead of the unusually shaped gear shifter are dual charging pads, a common design element in many modern Chinese cars.

The Tank 400 was first revealed in concept form in 2021, and the production version looks essentially unchanged.

Every Tank concept has subsequently been revealed in production guise apart from the flagship 800, a turbocharged V6-powered luxury SUV.
