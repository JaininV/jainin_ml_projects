The Philippines has been officially included in the 32nd Southeast Asian Games men’s volleyball competition in Cambodia after being left out in the initial draw two weeks ago due to a clerical oversight.

Organizers of the biennial meet scheduled to open on 5 May announced on Tuesday the inclusion of the national men’s team following the agreement of the Volleyball Federation of Cambodia and all the National Olympic Committees of the seven participating teams to a re-draw.

The Filipinos, who are looking to return to the podium after a silver medal finish in the 2019 edition held in Manila, were drawn in Group A joined by defending champion Indonesia, last year’s bronze medalist Cambodia and Singapore.

The Nationals landed at fifth spot in the pandemic-delayed Hanoi Games.

An oversight in the submission of entries excluded the Filipinos in the draw held last 5 April.

The Philippine Olympic Committee appealed to the organizers for a re-draw which was permitted given that other participating countries agree to the team’s inclusion and participation.

Cambodia Southeast Asia Games Organizing Committee head Samdach Picheysena Thea Banh gave permission for the re-draw which was decided 14 April.

The Filipinos under Brazilian head coach Sergio Valadares Veloso are currently in Japan for a 15-day training camp in Osaka.

Vince Mangulabnan skippers the squad along with Jau Umandal, who was instrumental in the team’s silver finish four years ago, Kim Dayandante, Vince Patrick Lorenzo, Jayvee Sumagaysay, Rwenzmel Taguibolos, Leo Ordiales, Manuel Sumanguid III, Steven Charles Rotter, Cyrus Justin De Guzman, Michael Raymund Vicente, 18-year-old Jade Disquitado and college players Lloyd Josafat and Jay Rack dela Noche.

The national team will fly back to Manila on 23 April before heading to Cambodia at the end of this month as the competition begins on 3 May.
