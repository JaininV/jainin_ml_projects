Bill Goldberg recently spoke to 93.7 The Ticket about how WWE violated an agreement that was in place for his retirement match.

According to Goldberg, he and Vince McMahon had agreed upon a proper retirement match for his career that was scheduled to happen after his bout with Roman Reigns at WWE Elimination Chamber 2022.

However, WWE didn’t follow up on the said match, leaving Goldberg disappointed.

You can check out some highlights from the podcast below:

On WWE not following through on a proper retirement match for him: “I’ll stop the rumor mill right now. The reason why these rumors are out there is because Vince McMahon and I had a handshake understanding that after the Roman Reigns match, I would have a proper retirement match. That hasn’t come to fruition through them … and nobody puts a stamp on my career. Nobody tells me when I’m done. Period. End of story.”

On his character deserving a proper sendoff: “At the end of the day … I do believe that my character deserves a proper sendoff. And until that happens, I don’t believe I’m hanging them up. Anything and everything is an option … Let the rumor mill start up after that.”
