US writer Judy Blume has pledged her support to JK Rowling over the online abuse she has received for her gender-critical views.

Blume has herself been criticised for including social and sexual issues facing her young readership in her work, and has defended her fellow author facing a “tough time”.

She said she is “100 per cent behind” Rowling as she faces online abuse for raising concerns about women’s spaces and gender ideology.

In January, the Harry Potter author reported an online death threat to Police Scotland and has previously compared the online insults she received to the domestic abuse she previously suffered.

Voicing her solidarity with Rowling, Blume told the Sunday Times: “I love her. I am behind her 100 per cent as I watch from afar.”
