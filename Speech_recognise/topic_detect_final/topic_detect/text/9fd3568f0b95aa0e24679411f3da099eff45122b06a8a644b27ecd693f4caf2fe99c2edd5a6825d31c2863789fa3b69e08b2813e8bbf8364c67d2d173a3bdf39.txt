Highlighting the benefits of ethanol-free alkylate fuel for machinery, people and the planet, Aspen will be back at The Arb Show on stand A08, as it returns to Westonbirt Arboretum this May. Celebrating 35 years as pioneers of alkylate fuel during 2023, Aspen are delighted to be extending their ‘Experience the Difference’ trial – giving businesses the opportunity to use the 2 and 4-stroke fuel risk-free and discover the improvements for themselves… or get their money-back!

Being free from ethanol, benzene and most other hazardous hydrocarbons found in traditional pump petrol, Aspen Fuel powers a cleaner, greener workstyle for many leading landscape, arboriculture and ground care professionals. The cleaner burn achieved with Aspen not only makes for a more pleasant operator environment, but engine performance is maintained without many of the costly reliability issues associated with component failure – particularly when equipment is left for extended periods in storage.

Concerns around the cost or logistics can often delay the decision to make the switch to Aspen which triggered the ‘Experience the Difference’ offer, meaning business owners can trial the fuel without incurring any additional cost. “We typically find that most companies overestimate their total annual fuel consumption” explains Business Development Manager Axel Hildebrand. “Through this initiative, people discover the simple accounting and all the sustainability benefits of protecting equipment, operators and the surrounding environment that makes Aspen an option too good to ignore.”

One of those who knows how advantageous Aspen can be is Tony Gascoyne who has been using Aspen Alkylate fuel in his business, The Arborist Limited, since 2016. Tony, along with the Aspen team, will be on stand A08 across the two days to answer any visitor questions and discuss his own first-hand experience of using Aspen in his day-to-day tree management operation.
