Storm likely not to affect flooding situation, according to WSA

A winter storm bearing down on Moose Jaw this week will bring more moisture to the area, but will it affect the flooding situation along the Moose Jaw River?

A Colorado Low is expected to hit Moose Jaw starting Tuesday night and into Wednesday and Thursday, bringing 10 to 25 centimetres of snow.

According to the Water Security Agency, the storm will likely have minimal effect on the river’s water levels.

“Well, it'll likely just prolong the runoff so you just get a bit more (runoff) moving forward. So, it's not a real big impact there. We're not expecting large impacts from it,” said Patrick Boyle from the Water Security Agency.

Boyle added that, in this case, getting snow was the best-case scenario compared to rain because of the fact it will need time to melt.

“A lot of that will melt and absorb into the ground and that moisture will release slowly versus rain, which can come off the landscape and contribute to higher water levels as you go forward,” he said.

The Moose Jaw River’s flow peaked on Monday at 52 cubic metres per second above the city and 79 cubic metres per second below Spring Creek and Thunder Creek. Boyle said the levels are similar to March of 2022.

Meanwhile, most of the ice cleared off over the weekend with only minor ice jam issues and any future ice jam issues will be minimal.
