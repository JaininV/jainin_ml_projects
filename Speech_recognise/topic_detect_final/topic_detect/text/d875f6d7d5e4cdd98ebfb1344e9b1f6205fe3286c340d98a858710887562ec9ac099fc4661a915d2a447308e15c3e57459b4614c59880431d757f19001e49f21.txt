“I accidentally took this photo while my phone was in my pocket, but it turned out really cool. I like how it was an accident because it kind of represents how some interesting things can come from total accidents. I just like how the light coming through the holes in my pocket formed such a neat pattern that gives off a sort of flashy vibe.”
