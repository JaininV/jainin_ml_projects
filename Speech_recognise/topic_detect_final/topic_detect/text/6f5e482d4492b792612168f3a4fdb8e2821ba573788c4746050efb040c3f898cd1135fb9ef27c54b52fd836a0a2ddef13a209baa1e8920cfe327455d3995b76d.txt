There were 15 golfers who battled wet and windy conditions to play a stableford event for the third round of the Heather Walker Memorial trophy at the Millicent Golf Club last week.

Heidi Muhovics stole the show with an impressive 39 points to claim victory in B Grade.

There was a nail-biting battle for the win in A Grade as Sue Agnew defeated Debbie Tincknell by one point.

Watson also won the nine-hole competition on a count-back with her 17 points on the front nine.

Sharne Peacock, Julie McKenzie and Kirsty Bailey were the ball-winners.

Helen Chilton was the nearest to pin for the third hole, while Bailey was nearest on the 13th and Muhovics was closest for the second shot on the 17th hole.
