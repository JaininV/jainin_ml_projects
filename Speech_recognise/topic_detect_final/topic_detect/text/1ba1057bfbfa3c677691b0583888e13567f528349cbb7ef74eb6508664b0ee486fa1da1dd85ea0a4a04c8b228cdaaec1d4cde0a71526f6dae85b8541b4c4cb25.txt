Finance Minister Grant Robertson has announced an additional $25 million to help more businesses in the clean-up from the damage caused by Cyclone Gabrielle.

This follows $50 million announced earlier in the year designed to assist the business community with immediate cashflow needs.

“The priority has been to get business back up and running as quickly as possible from the impact of the cyclone, working through the local agencies on the ground who know their area best,” Robertson says.

“Demand for grants has been strong, with applications to the local providers managing the funding exceeding the $50 million allocated. Based on the most recent assessment an additional $22 million is required to meet the additional demand, with around 5,800 applications received,” he says.

“The split of this additional funding between regions will be based on the latest available data. Ministers are committed to ensuring that it is focused on those regions where the need is greatest.”

“We are committed to helping people and businesses recover from the cyclone. The way we do that will change as we shift from the response to recovery phase will change,” Robertson says. “We will continue to closely monitor the needs of local communities and work with local agencies, iwi and councils as we move from response to the recovery and rebuild from these extreme weather events.”
