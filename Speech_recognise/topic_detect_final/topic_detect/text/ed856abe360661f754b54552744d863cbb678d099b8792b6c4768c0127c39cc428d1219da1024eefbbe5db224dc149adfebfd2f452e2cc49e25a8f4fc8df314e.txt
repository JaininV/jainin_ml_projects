Although the 35th Anniversary of the Air Max 1 is over, Nike Sportswear will drop multiple color options as if the model was celebrating a significant milestone. This, of course, is great for fans of the model, and we can expect more to come soon. Following our look at several Air Max 1 ’86 colorways, we also previewed the ‘Chili 2.0’, ‘Urawa’, and we announced the ‘Keep Rippin Stop Slippin 2.0’ dropping. Building upon the list, we have a pair highlighted in ‘Bronze’ that will launch in Summer 2023.

This Nike Air Max 1 comes dressed in a Light Orewood Brown, Bronze, White, and Black color combination. Constructed with the usual suede, mesh, and leather. White runs across the base with Grey suede on the overlays. Highlighting the shoes is Bronze leather on the Swoosh logos and mudguards. Other details include a White midsole and a Black rubber outsole.

Below, you can check out more photos of the Nike Air Max 1 ‘Bronze’ for a closer look. A release will take place at select retailers and Nike.com on July 7th. The retail price is $150. Make sure to check back with us for more updates.
