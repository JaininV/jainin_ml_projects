For the second consecutive year, the RBC Heritage provided a dramatic viewing experience involving Jordan Spieth.

The Dallas native posted a strong final round to tie for first place and head to playoff with Matt Fitzpatrick. Spieth won last year’s RBC Heritage after defeating Patrick Cantlay to claim his 13th PGA Tour title. He couldn’t make it back-to-back tournament wins, as Fitzpatrick held on to win it all.

Spieth came up with big moments throughout Sunday to set himself up near the top of the leaderboard. One of those moments included a par save on No. 10, where he got back on track after hitting his tee shot into the water.

Spieth and Fitzpatrick closed out the final round at 17-under to force the playoff. Both golfers set themselves up to win with strategic tee shots on hole 18, but endured near misses on the putting green. Spieth’s put on the first playoff hole narrowly lipped out, causing a visible reaction from the golfer and the audience in attendance.

Fitzpatrick ended up winning the tournament on the third playoff hole with a well-struck tee shot. The English golfer secured his second PGA Tour victory.
