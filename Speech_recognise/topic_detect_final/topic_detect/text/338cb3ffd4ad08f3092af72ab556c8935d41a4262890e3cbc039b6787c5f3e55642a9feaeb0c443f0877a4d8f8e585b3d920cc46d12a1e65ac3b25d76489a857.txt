Wagner Group Resorting to Desperate Measures to Make Up for Losses

The Wagner Group private military company (PMC) may be trying to force mobilized Russian personnel to sign contracts with the mercenaries fighting for Moscow to offset their troop losses in Ukraine.

Spearheading Moscow's fierce fight for the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut that has raged for months, the group, headed by businessman Yevgeny Prigozhin, has seen a huge number of troops killed in action.

"A group of around 170 mobilized men from these aircraft ... were forced to sign contracts with the Wagner PMC," Astra reported, citing the soldiers' relatives. Russian sources had previously reported that 100 mobilized personnel in Luhansk Oblast disappeared from April 7 after refusing to sign contracts with Wagner. The independent Russian language news outlet Astra shared a video of a group of mobilized personnel from the Moscow and Ivanovo regions complaining that they had been taken to Ukraine without their knowledge.

They had been sent by plane from Kursk to Rostov-on-Don supposedly for training but were then transferred at night to the Ukrainian oblast of Luhansk.

Taking a small, worthless mining town at the cost of tens of thousands of lives is one thing, holding it with only a handful of played out convicts is another.
