Stakes are high in this outrageously camp comedy horror as the gals behind last year’s hit show “Drag Queens vs. Zombies” return to Brighton Fringe 2023.

Local Brighton queen Crudi Dench and her award-winning drag pal Kate Butch star in this Hammer Horror-esque caper, which sees them jetting off to Transylvania for the final of the Eurovision Song Contest. Their trip becomes a bloody nightmare when their sexy Airbnb host Drac drives a wedge between the pair, threatening their lives and more importantly, chances of stardom.

Featuring the pair’s infectious brand of camp humour, audience interaction and fabulous musical numbers (including their own Eurovision single!) this fang-tastically funny new comedy from drag collective Haus of Dench is written by Matthew Stallworthy (As heard on BBC Radio 4 Extra) and Eleanor Mason (shortlisted for the 2021 Funny Women Comedy Writing Award).
