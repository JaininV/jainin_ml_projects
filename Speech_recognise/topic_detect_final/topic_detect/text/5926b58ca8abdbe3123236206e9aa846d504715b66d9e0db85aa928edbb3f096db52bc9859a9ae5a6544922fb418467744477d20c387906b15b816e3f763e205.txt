DR IAN MITCHELL has returned to Wales as head of performance psychology.

SunSport exclusively revealed last month that Mitchell has left the same post at the Football Association.

And Mitchell, part of Gareth Southgate's backroom staff for five years, rejoins Wales where he will work with boss Robert Page.

Wales have not had a psychologist since Mitchell left for the FA in February 2018 after becoming a key figure in Chris Coleman's set-up which included the memorable run to the Euro 2016 semi-finals.

Page stated in January he wanted a psychologist on board to provide an extra edge in the post-Gareth Bale era and Mitchell has now been appointed.

Page said: "We are delighted to announce Dr Ian Mitchell as our Head of Performance Psychology, the appointment reflects the ambition of the FAW to ensure we provide the highest possible standards to support our Cymru National Teams’ future success.

"Ian has extensive experience of working with elite footballers initially fulfilling this role following an extensive period of work as a recognised academic in the field of psychology and I look forward to working with him.”

Highly-rated Mitchell, who has also worked at Swansea when the Welsh side were in the Premier League, was popular among Football Association of Wales staff during his first stint.

He will begin work immediately ahead of the Euro 2024 qualifiers against Armenia in Cardiff on June 16 and away to Turkey three days later.

Mitchell said: “It’s an honour and a privilege to return to the FAW having been involved previously.

"2016 was incredible, it was a special group of players and staff with a strong environment both on and off the pitch in terms of a high performing culture.

"It’s an experience I hope to have again with the current regime.

"Wales is such a unique country with a great culture and a real sense of belonging and identity, I can’t wait to get started again.”
