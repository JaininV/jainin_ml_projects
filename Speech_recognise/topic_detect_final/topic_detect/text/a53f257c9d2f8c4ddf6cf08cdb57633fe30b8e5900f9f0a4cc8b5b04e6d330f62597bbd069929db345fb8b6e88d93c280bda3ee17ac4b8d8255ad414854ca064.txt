Hello Everyone,

I am writing my analysis after very long time because i was not actively trading for past few months. But, rising value of BTC was something we should not miss. hence, here i am again.

In this chart, you all can see my previous support and resistance levels. If bulls are in favor, BTC should create the support zone above 30500. It is very dicey to say at this point that BTC can go upto $40000. I am sharing through the green arrow line that we may see such moment in 1D candles.

Also, very important: Do you guys remember the date of blood bath in 2021 and 2022? well, whatever it is, it was in month of May. so be prepare, don't be so optimistic. Please put stop-loss every time.

please let me know your thoughts in the comment.

Have a safe trading!!!
