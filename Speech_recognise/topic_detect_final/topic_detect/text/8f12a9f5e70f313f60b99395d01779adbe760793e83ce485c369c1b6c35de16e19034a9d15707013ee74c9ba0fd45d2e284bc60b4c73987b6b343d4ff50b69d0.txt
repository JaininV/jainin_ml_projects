American country star Luke Bryan, 46, has been a judge on the globally renowned talent show American Idol since 2018, alongside his fellow judges pop star Katy Perry and “national treasure” Lionel Richie.

While both Katy and Lionel are confirmed to be headlining King Charles’ Coronation concert, arguably one of the biggest concerts of the era, Luke has now broken his silence after being entirely left out of the celebrations.

Speaking to Jimmy Kimmel on his late-night talk show earlier this week, Luke admitted it’s probably for the best he wasn’t invited.

He claimed: “I didn’t know what a Coronation was. I thought it was a form of condensed milk or something…carnation…tarnation?”

The Knockin’ Boots singer revealed that when he first found out his costars would be serenading the King, alongside his Dukes and Earls, he told them: “The only Dukes and Earls I’ve ever hung with I shotgunned beer in high school with.”
