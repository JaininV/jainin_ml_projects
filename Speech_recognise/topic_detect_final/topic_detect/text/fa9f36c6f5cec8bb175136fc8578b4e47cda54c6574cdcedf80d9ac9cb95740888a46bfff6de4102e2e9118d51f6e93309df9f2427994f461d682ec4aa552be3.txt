A 77-year old woman is hospitalized in critical condition after getting shot while sitting on the balcony of her second-floor apartment.

Annie Pierre Louis was shot on Tuesday, only a day after a teen was shot while in the parking lot of another apartment complex less than a half mile away.

"This is right on the heels of a 16-year old boy getting shot yesterday.  Police have said that he has been paralyzed from the neck down."

Delray Beach Fire Rescue Spokeswoman Dani Moschella tells CBS 12 News that investigators are looking into whether the two cases are connected.  That's why they're asking the public to come forward with information.

The elderly woman's grandson, Steeveson Louis, believes whoever shot her was targeting someone else.

"I don't think nobody was coming to look for a 77-year old woman."

The man is pleading with the public to come forward with information.

"You should come out and say something if you know something.  Get him off the street before someone else get hit."

Anyone with information is asked to call Sgt. Casey Kelly at 561-243-7890.
