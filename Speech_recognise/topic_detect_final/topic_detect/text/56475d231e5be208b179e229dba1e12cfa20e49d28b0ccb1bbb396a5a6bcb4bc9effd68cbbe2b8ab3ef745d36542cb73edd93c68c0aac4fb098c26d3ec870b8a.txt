A convicted sex offender has been urged to give his £7m National Lottery winnings to charity.

The call comes after Iorworth Hoare, who was jailed in 1989 but has been released on licence, won a 15-year legal battle to access the money, according to reports in The Mirror newspaper.

Hoare was given a life sentence for trying to rape Shirley Woodman in Leeds in 1988. He already had prior convictions for rape, attempted rape and indecent assault.

It is reported that he won the lottery when he bought a ticket while on leave from an open prison in 2004.

Shelley Wolfson, Woodman’s daughter, told The Mirror that her mother sued Hoare for thousands of pounds in damages and then gave the money to charity.

Wolfson said: “She gave all the money away and it’s what he should be doing with his money.

“I certainly do think he should pay back the system like my mum wanted him to and help good causes.”

Woodman, who donated a total of £50,000 to unnamed charities, died last year.
