Brooke Shields claims that John F. Kennedy Jr. showed his “true colors” when she turned down his s*xual advances on their first and only date.

The actress told listeners of “The Howard Stern Show” on Tuesday that she “froze” at the thought of s*x after President John F. Kennedy’s son gave her the “best kiss” of her life on a “real date” in Aspen, Colorado.

Brooke Shields, who was still a v*rg*n at the time, didn’t think she could “handle” it if the lawyer didn’t talk to her after they did the deed.

I was like, ‘Oh my God, you’re falling in love and if you sleep with him, he may not talk to you again,’

I wasn’t playing a game, I really was just so afraid of being really hurt,

Because if I slept with him, I would have given him my entire universe, my heart, my everything.

The “Pretty Baby” star went on to say that she had been “madly in love” with him since age 3.

My mom, [Teri Shields], would say, ‘That’s the boy you’re going to marry,’

When Brooke Shields turned down Kennedy Jr.’s s*xual advances because she “kind of loved him too much,” she was left to find her own way back to the ski chalet.

I had to get a cab home, which was a little less chivalrous, in my opinion,

After Kennedy Jr. ignored her on the slopes, the actress from “Endless Love” thought the next day that she had made the right choice.

He didn’t look at me and he didn’t talk to me,

On the one hand, I was like, ‘S–t.’ On the other hand, I was like, ‘Oh, thank God, because he still might not have talked to you [if you had sex with him].’

He showed his true colors in that.

Kennedy Jr. later married publicist Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy in 1996. They both died in a plane crash three years later.

Shields was married to Agassi for two years.

In 2001, she got married to producer Chris Henchy. They have two daughters together: Rowan (19) and Grier (16)
