Check out these 2 must-do exercises for a massive chest.

When it comes to training, the chest is one of the most sought out muscle groups, regardless of gender. There is something about the chest that people simply want to make look leaner, stronger, and fitter.

The frequency with which you should train your chest depends on various factors such as your fitness goals, training level, and the intensity of your workouts. However, a general guideline for most people is to train their chest muscles 1-2 times per week.

If you are a beginner, it’s recommended to start with one chest workout per week to allow your muscles to recover and adapt to the new stimulus. As you progress, you may increase the frequency to two times per week to stimulate further muscle growth and development.

On the other hand, if you are an advanced lifter or a bodybuilder, you may benefit from training your chest more frequently, up to three times per week, as part of a split routine.

It’s important to listen to your body and give your chest muscles enough time to recover between workouts to prevent injury and overtraining. Additionally, incorporating a variety of exercises and rep ranges into your chest workouts can help prevent plateaus and stimulate muscle growth.
