UAE astronaut Sultan Al Neyadi has posted a video of Madinah, Makkah, and Jeddah from the International Space Station (ISS).

"From the international space station, a gift for Salman's children on these blessed nights. Dedication to the country of the Two Holy Mosques, the landing site of revelation and the land of the message, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia," Al Neyadi tweeted.

The video showed the cities lit up and Saudi Arabia's Grand Mosque glowing in the dark "like shining stars."

Al Neyadi has been on a six-month mission since March 3rd, making it the Arab world's first long-duration space trip.

The astronaut is currently preparing to embark on a spacewalk scheduled for Friday, April 28th. This will be the first time for the UAE and any other Arab nation.
