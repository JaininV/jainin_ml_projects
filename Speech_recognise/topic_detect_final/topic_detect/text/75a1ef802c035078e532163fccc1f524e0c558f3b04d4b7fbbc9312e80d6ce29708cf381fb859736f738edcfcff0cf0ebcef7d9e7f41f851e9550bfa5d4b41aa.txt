YouTube Premium is an exclusive subscription service that allows one to binge-watch their favorite videos ad-free.

Along with this, subscribers also get access to improved music playback quality and can play videos or music in the background.

Also, one can easily choose between regular, quarterly, and annual plans according to their budget.

However, some are currently experiencing issues with the Premium membership.

According to reports (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8), multiple users are alleging that their YouTube Premium Student plans are being mistakenly converted into Individual plans.

The platform provides students with specialized plans for both YouTube Music Premium and YouTube Premium. This membership is generally available at a discounted rate and valid for a period of up to four years.

As per the reports, those who opted for the specialized student plans have recently started getting emails that they are being migrated to the individual plan.

As a result, they have got sad and disappointed.

Hi, can you please explain why my student discount is being resended? I have verified on sheer ID, and YouTube Premium is available in my country.

Some have even tried to cancel their current membership, get a refund and sign up for the student plan once again as directed by YouTube support. However, this trick didn’t work for them.

And expectedly, the affected ones are now asking the developers to resolve the issue soon.

Fortunately, the YouTube support team on Twitter has officially acknowledged this problem and is currently working on fixing it. Although, no official ETA for the same has been shared.

We do hope that YouTube will resolve this problem soon.
