Vancouver’s RealWear canceled plans to become a publicly traded company, citing current market conditions in the decision, the company’s chairman and CEO said in a statement Wednesday.

The company had planned to take their assisted reality business to the public marketplace as part of a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, deal with Seattle-based Cascadia Acquisition Corp.

Cascadia is an acquisition company, also referred to as a blank check company, that was created to affect mergers, stock purchases or other business combinations. It’s affiliated with the investment banking group Cascadia Capital LLC.

SPAC companies don’t operate commercially but rather raise capital through an initial public offering to acquire or merge with another company.

Cascadia announced Tuesday that the combination agreement with RealWear Inc. wouldn’t be moving forward and that it was terminated “in accordance with the terms of the agreement.”
