When dealing with a moisture-laden baked good, your top priority needs to be maintaining its moisture level. This means as soon as it's out of the oven and you're slicing into it, the cake turns into a ticking time bomb of dryness. In order to prevent it from becoming an arid, lifeless mess, you need to set the cake inside an airtight container.

If you are baking your coffee cake ahead of time, you should also secure your baked good into an airtight container. Treat your cake like a great valuable that needs to be under protective glass at all times. Because if you don't, the cake will be robbed of its moisture, and that theft will leave you (and your guests!) wishing for that once-moist piece of cake.

Thankfully, you can purchase containers made specifically for storing cakes, so you don't have to mash it down to the size of a casserole dish. Nobody likes baking a cake and then being forced to slash away at it so it fits into whatever air-tight Tupperware container is available. It's a minor investment, but it will make a major difference.
