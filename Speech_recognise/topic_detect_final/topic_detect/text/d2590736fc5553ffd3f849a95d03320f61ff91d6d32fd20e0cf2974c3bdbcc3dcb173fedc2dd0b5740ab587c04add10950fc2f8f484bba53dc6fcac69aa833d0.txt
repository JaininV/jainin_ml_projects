Some WWE Superstars are better off as either natural heels or babyfaces, and it helps them climb the proverbial ladder. There are a few, however, who work well either way. According to fans, Dolph Ziggler is one such superstar.

The 42-year-old veteran is a former MITB winner and WWE World Heavyweight Champion. Despite all the makings of a legend, Ziggler somehow always finds himself in the mid-card. The company does occasionally place him in prominent storylines, but most of the other times he is criminally underutilized.

When a fan recently pointed out on Twitter that Dolph Ziggler would make a "great babyface," the veteran jokingly responded:

Dolph Ziggler was one-half of the tag team "Dirty Dawgs" alongside Bobby Roode. The latter is yet another underutilized former world champion (outside WWE). A recent report surfaced regarding the injured star's status.

Ziggler and Roode were a successful tag team on the RAW brand prior to the latter getting sidelined to undergo neck surgery.

When you think of famous MITB cash-ins, Ziggler's cash-in certainly comes to mind. Now, with the benefit of hindsight, does it trump Edge's cash-in on John Cena back in 2006, or Seth Rollins' during the main event of WrestleMania 31 in 2015?

Dolph Ziggler thinks so, and The Show Off has a strong argument for it as well. The crowd's reaction to Ziggler cashing-in on Alberto Del Rio has to be seen to be believed. Many fans consider the former WWE World Heavyweight Champion's moment under the sun the best. On the Insights with Chris Van Vliet podcast, Dolph Ziggler had this to say:

Ziggler explained that him being on the losing end for several months prior to the cash-in is what made the moment he won the world championship incredibly special:

Unfortunately, for Ziggler, an untimely injury kept him from defending the title despite holding it for 70 days, The Show Off dropped the belt back to Del Rio at Payback 2012, in a solid match best remembered for the remarkable double turn.
