I AGREE we need to provide more broadband access to certain areas of the state and the Southwest. However, more thought must be put into that concept than this last boondoggle. (April 4)’s story where politicians preened and big-shots posed required further research.

• 206 people and five businesses in Catron County for $24 million;

• 550 people and 11 businesses in Peñasco for $13.9 million;

• 27 people in rural DeBaca and San Miguel counties for $2.6 million.

Politicians and U. S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack touted the spending of $40 million in the state but did not justify the spending. Yes, it’s great if you’re one of those 27 people in eastern New Mexico. But what is the true cost?

I acknowledge the line may eventually be used by other people who theoretically will now move to these remote areas because they can remotely work because of the faster internet speed. It’s highly doubtful, however, and at what cost and what benefit?

The other important issue not discussed in the story is whether the line will be run past these relatively few houses or will it actually be run into their yards and be physically connected to their houses? It’s nice for politicians to say there’s high speed internet available. It’s another to say those 550 people are actually connected.

Here in Rio Arriba County REDINet was touted during the Obama years as our answer to dial-up and very slow internet speeds. While I owned and operated the Rio Grande Sun during that project’s many hiccups and false starts, I could boast the huge fiber optic cable ran just a few hundred yards from my front door. It may as well have been 100 miles, as I couldn’t connect to it.

Do the math on this internet spending

(APRIL 4)’S JOURNAL eye-opening story reported $40 million in federal dollars is to be spent providing internet service for Peñasco Valley, Western New Mexico and E. N.M.R. Telephone customers.

For 609 Peñasco Valley customers, the plan is to spend $13,900,000 to provide service. That’s $22,824.30 per customer. For the same price, each of those customers could be given free 12.7 years of HughesNet Satellite’s fastest service or 15.36 years of Starlink’s residential service.

For 206 Western New Mexico Telephone customers, $24,000,000 will be spent — $111,111.11 per customer. For the same expenditure, those 206 customers could each get 61.7 years of service from Hughes Satellite or 76.67 years from Starlink.

The E. N.M.R. Telephone Co-op customers will have spending of $2,600,000. That’s $92,857.14 per customer. Or they could get free service from Hughes for 51.6 years or 64 years from Starlink.

FYI: HughesNet’s top plan costs $149 a month for the first two years under a required 2-year contract. It’s kind of slow, but fast enough for streaming. But it’s limited to about an hour a day. Hughes installs the system, but you’ll need to install a router.

Starlink Satellite costs $700 in the first month for hardware, shipping and the first month’s service in Albuquerque. It has fast download speeds for streaming, provides unlimited data, is fast enough for gaming and costs $110 per month.

(I) READ IN (April 4th’s) paper that thanks to the hard work of our elected representatives, the federal government is giving the state $40 million for rural broadband. We’re going to use that money to put in a little over 800 broadband connections.

That’s over $49,000 per connection. Last time I looked, the full retail price for a Starlink terminal was $650, and the monthly fee was $120. Not cheap by any means, but $40 million spent on Starlink would buy over 2,600 broadband connections and pay their monthly fees for 10 years. Not much pork in Starlink though; can’t crow about “jobs” or “infrastructure” on the campaign trail.
