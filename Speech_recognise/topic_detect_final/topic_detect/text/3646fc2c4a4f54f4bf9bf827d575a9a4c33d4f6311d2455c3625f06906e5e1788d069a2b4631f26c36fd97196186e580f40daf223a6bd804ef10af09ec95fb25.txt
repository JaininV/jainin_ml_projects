In Colaba, one of India’s most revered art markets, stands The Kalanjee Project, a 100-plus year-old bungalow. The 7,000 square feet heritage site has recently been converted into Gallery XXL, which brings the flavour of urban contemporary and post graffiti art to this traditional art market, adding another layer of dynamism to it. “One of our goals is to let viewers experience urban art. We felt that someone needed to take the initiative to represent this very important art movement,” says gallery Director and CEO Joe Cyril. The gallery opened on 13 April with the show Outsiders, where over 20 artists’ work has been displayed, and is curated by Amitabh Kumar.

As an artist himself, Kumar has been part of the urban art movement since 2012. Trained in art school, with his work exhibited at galleries, he was among the artists looking for more avenues to showcase their work. “It felt very restrictive at that time to have this straitjacketed idea of an artist. We had other ambitions and when we started painting in public spaces what really drove us at that time was a connection with the people,” he adds.

With this mindset, several artists in India took to making art in public spaces. It was also around this time that Guesswho shot to fame, putting India on the global urban art map. With the emergence of the St+art India Foundation in 2014 that works to make art more accessible and with a focus on art activism with the coming of the Aravani Art Project in 2016, street art has steadily grown in India over the last decade. “What we’ve witnessed is a range of artists really blurring the boundary between accepted notions of where people make images,” says Kumar. The coming of XXL is the next big landmark in the story of the global art movement in India.
