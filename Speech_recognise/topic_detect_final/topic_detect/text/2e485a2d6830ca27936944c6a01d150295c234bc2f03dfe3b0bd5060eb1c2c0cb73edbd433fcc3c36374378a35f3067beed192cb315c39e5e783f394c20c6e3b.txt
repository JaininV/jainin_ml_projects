The Moose Jaw Express/MooseJawToday.com is running a “Wish List Drive” to help the Moose Jaw Humane Society (MJHS) collect food, toys, treats, litter, and other items that help them look after the community’s animals.

“So, we are set and ready to rock … and thrilled to partner with Moose Jaw Today,” said Donna Fritzke, fundraising co-ordinator for the MJHS. Fritzke worked with Wanda Hall and Krista McDonald at Moose Jaw Express/MooseJawToday.com to create the contest.

“We will run the ‘Wish List Drive” from our office from April 17th to April 30th. The draw will be held May 1st. We are giving away 4 sweatshirts in total, from our own stock, as the prizes… This should be lots of fun and hopefully we can get a good amount of donations.”

The goal of the contest is to fill the Moose Jaw Express circulation van with donation items. The complete list of items includes:

Donations can be delivered to the Moose Jaw Express office at 468 High Street West. Each donation will earn participants an entry into the prize pack draws on May 1.

Participants can earn extra entries with each donation in two ways:

Take a selfie outside the Express office with the donation, post it to Facebook or Instagram, and tag the Express (@MooseJawExpress).

Be wearing newly purchased Humane Society Swag in the selfie.

By following the above steps, contest participants can earn three contest entries with every donation.

On May 1, the MJHS will draw for four prize packs. Each pack includes:

The clothing prizes, produced by Sask Promo, feature a new MJHS animal logo created by digital artist Skye Mercier (Pet Portraits by Skye).

The colouring books have been printed by Grand Valley Press.

The MJHS is beginning a spring/summer donation drive they hope will keep them running all year and they are counting on the community’s support.
