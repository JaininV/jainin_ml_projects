ONE OF THE BAST

FORMER Manchester United star Bastian Schweinsteiger sang the praises of AC Milan's Rafael Leao after his superb assist against Napoli.

The seven-time Champions League winners progressed to the semi-final after beating Napoli 2-1 on aggregate.

Olivier Giroud scored the key goal but Leao has stolen the plaudits for his remarkable solo run that allowed the Frenchman to tap into an empty net.

Leao, 23, picked up the ball in his own half and quickly beat his first marker before gliding past another defender.

All of a sudden it was two on three and Leao showed amazing strength and balance to skip past Amir Rrahmani before squaring for Giroud to score.

Schweinsteiger was blown away by the passage of play and heaped praise on the Portugal international.

He tweeted: "Rafael LeÃ£oâ€˜s assist for Giroud was one of the best I have seen for a long time!

"If LeÃ£o can prove his qualities more often he will be one of the top three players in the world."

Fans agreed with the Bayern Munich icon and lavished praise on Leao.

One said: "The acceleration to get through Amir Rrahmani was so special ðŸ˜µ"

Another added: "That run was incredible. He has the potential to be one of the best in the world with that quality but for players like him with all the technical abilities, it's about mentality to reach the very top. He has the technical ability we all know that and can clearly see that."

A third said: "100% Basti and I've been saying it for a while. He's as good as [Kylian] Mbappe when on it."

Another remarked: "Agree! His balance, touch and pace with the ball is unreal."
