Strictly has introduced us to a legion of professional dancers over its two decades dazzling up our screens, and unless they're involved in some sort of Strictly scandal (not naming names), we often don't get to know them right away – all dance and no chat kind of vibes. So let's start rectifying that today by getting to know fierce Strictly pro, Nancy Xu, who was partnered with timeless heartthrob Will Mellor last series.

No jealousy from our corner at all.

What's that? Are we starting with Nancy, so we can rewatch Will Mellor dancing? Nooo...

Nancy is a dancer and choreographer who specialises in Latin. She has taken part in various competitions, including the Under 21 World Championships in 2010. In 2015, she began dancing in Burn the Floor, a dance show on Broadway and in the West End, which some of her Strictly cast mates have also danced in, including Karen Hauer and Johannes Radebe.

Nancy is 31 years old. She was born on 30 July 1991.

No, she’s not, but she is in a relationship with bodyguard Mike Michele. Mike also practices martial arts and, like his girlfriend, is a choreographer. Power couple vibes, basically.

Her full name is Nancy Xu YouJie.

Nancy is Chinese. She was born in Hunan, China.

She has been on Strictly since the seventeenth series in 2019.

During the 2022 series, Nancy was partnered with actor Will Mellor. It was the second time that she’d been paired with a celebrity. The first time was in 2021 when she was coupled up with CBBC presenter Rhys Stephenson. The first two years of her stint saw her be a part of the Strictly pro dance troupe.

Yep. You can follow her on Instagram at @nancy_xuxi.
