When buying a helmet, several factors must be considered to ensure your safety and comfort. Here are some things to keep in mind:

Fitting: The helmet should fit snugly on your head without being too tight. Make sure it sits level on your head and doesn’t move around. A loose helmet won’t protect you in case of an accident.

Weight: A lighter helmet is more comfortable to wear for longer periods. However, remember that lighter helmets may not provide as much protection as heavier ones.

Budget: Helmets come in various prices, so decide how much you’re willing to spend before you start shopping.

Padding: Look for a helmet with enough padding to make it comfortable to wear for extended periods. The padding should also be removable and washable.

Vision: Make sure the helmet doesn’t obstruct your vision. You should be able to see clearly in all directions.

Comfort: Consider how long you’ll be wearing the helmet. Look for features like ventilation and adjustable straps that make it more comfortable to wear for longer periods.

Visor: Helmets with a visor offer additional protection from the sun, wind, and debris. Ensure the visor is easy to use and doesn’t obstruct your vision.

Type: There are different types of helmets, such as full-face, open-face, and modular. Choose one that suits your needs and riding style.

ISI Mark: Look for helmets with the ISI mark, which indicates that the helmet meets safety standards set by the Bureau of Indian Standards.

Inner Cushioning: The helmet’s inner cushioning should be made of high-quality materials that can absorb impact and protect your head in case of an accident.

Brand: Choose a reputable brand known for producing high-quality helmets with good safety ratings.

Considering these factors, you can find a helmet that fits well, provides adequate protection, and is comfortable to wear for extended periods.
