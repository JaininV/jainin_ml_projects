I have three nRF52840 boards and have been running the examples MESH and MESH-PROVISONER().One provisioner and two nodes. Can data transmission still occur between a provisioner and node after provisioning is completed? For example, can a node control the provisioner's LED while the provisioner maintains its own functionality?Is it possible to use a provisioner as a node in the mesh network？

How to measure latency in Bluetooth mesh？（or Inter BLE node latency？）

Is the "delay" here referring to the latency between two nodes？

Thanks in advance for your help!
