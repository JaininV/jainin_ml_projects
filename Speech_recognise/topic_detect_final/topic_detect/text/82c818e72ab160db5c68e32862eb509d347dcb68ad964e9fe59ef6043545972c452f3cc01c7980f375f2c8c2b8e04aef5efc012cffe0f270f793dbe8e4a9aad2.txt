Let’s assist DCCDC this Spring with a Spring Yard Clean-up by spreading new mulch and replacing any plantings that might not have made it through the winter. Last year Rotary assisted with landscaping/planting at the center once the new playground was completed. This year, let’s freshen it up for Spring!

Note: In the past we have asked all volunteers to bring gloves, shovels, and spades for digging weeds. We also need heavy-duty paper lawn and leaf bags.
