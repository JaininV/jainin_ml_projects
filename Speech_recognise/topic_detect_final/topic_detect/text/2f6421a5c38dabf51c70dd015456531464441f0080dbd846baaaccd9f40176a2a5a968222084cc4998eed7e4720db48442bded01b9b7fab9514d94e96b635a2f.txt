Ekin-Su Culculoglu has confirmed she has forgiven her boyfriend Davide Sanclimenti after accusing another woman of sleeping with him.

The Turkish beauty, 28, who won the show with beau Davide, also 28, last year, is said to have branded Harriet Wilson, 24, a 'f***ing s**g' over her suspected fling with the Italian hunk.

But it appears all is well once again with Ekin-Su and Davide as they appeared in an Instagram video together on Tuesday.

Davide shared a clip of himself trying on some new gym tops before Ekin-Su appeared and gave him a kiss.

Davide teased his girlfriend's arrival with the caption: 'Trying on gym tops and...' before she appeared to hand him a drink.

The pair looked loved-up as the wrapped their arms around each other, no doubt eager to let fans know they are still together.

According to The Sun on Sunday, Ekin-Su was said to have also called the model 'disgusting' and fumed 'You’re finished' in angry messages after allegedly finding texts from her on Davide's phone.

The publication reports that the Turkish TV star also lashed out at a second woman, Phoebe Wintle, after also reportedly discovering her texts on his mobile.

Ekin-Su's alleged outburst came after she returned from a trip to Belfast earlier this month and had feared that Davide had hooked up with Harriet and Phoebe.

In messages reportedly seen by The Sun on Sunday, Ekin-Su is said to have ranted: 'You f***ing s**g. Sleeping with my boyfriend! Disgusting. Why would you do that?

'You and Phoebe are gonna be shown to everyone slags. Pretending nothing happened. Just wait for it. You cow. You’re finished mate.'

A source is said to have told the publication that Harriet was 'taken aback' by the Instagram messages, adding: 'What makes it worse is that they knew each other before this all kicked off.

'Harriet used to keep an eye on Davide for Ekin-Su on his nights out in Manchester and report back to her.'

The couple headed off on a make-or-break trip to Amsterdam last week, and while Davide shared a snap of the beauty at breakfast, she failed to upload an image of him.

Earlier this month, Ekin was reportedly left furious after finding messages and pictures from two models on Davide' s phone.

The reality star is said to have been 'fuming and upset' as she suspected Davide had a romantic rendezvous with the pair, who are said to be regulars on the Manchester party scene.

Actress Ekin-Su allegedly messaged one of the girls to ask what had gone on after the reality star returned from a trip to Belfast.

A source told The Sun: 'It all exploded last Sunday after she found messages on Davide’s phone discussing their time together.

'He had been messaging both of the girls and she suspected they had all met up one night.

'Ekin-Su contacted one of the girls to tell them she knew about things. She was furious and really upset.'

Television personality Ekin-Su posted a number of cryptic social media messages, including a tweet which appear to mock Harriet's Instagram snaps.

The post, which has since been deleted, read: 'No man will ever take u seriously with just half naked pictures of u in a bikini and lingerie'.

While she also liked two posts from another user which mentioned 'disrespect' and the need for 'distance', according to the publication.

She also shared some words on Instagram which read: 'A girl can be just as sexy without showing some skin.'

The pair moved in together after winning Love Island last year but earlier this year were forced to dismiss claims their relationship was a showmance.
