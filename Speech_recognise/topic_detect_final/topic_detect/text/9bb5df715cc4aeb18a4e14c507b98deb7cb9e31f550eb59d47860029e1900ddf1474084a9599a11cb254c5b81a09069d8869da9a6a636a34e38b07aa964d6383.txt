Parkinson’s disease is a progressive disorder that is caused by degeneration of nerve cells in the part of the brain called the substantia nigra, which controls movement. These nerve cells die or become impaired, losing the ability to produce an important chemical called dopamine. Studies have shown that symptoms of Parkinson’s develop in patients with an 80 percent or greater loss of dopamine-producing cells in the substantia nigra. Normally, dopamine operates in a delicate balance with other neurotransmitters to help coordinate the millions of nerve and muscle cells involved in movement.

* In December 2021, Pharma Two B Ltd., announced that its Phase III double-blind, active-controlled study of P2B001 in early Parkinson’s disease successfully met its primary and key secondary endpoints in the Phase III study, P2B001 was superior to each of its individual components as measured by the change from baseline to week 12 in total Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS Part II and III; primary endpoint). P2B001 was superior to the pramipexole component by 2.66 points (p=0.0018) and superior to the rasagiline component by 3.30 points (p=0.0001).

* In December 2021, UCB announced that it has entered into a global co-development and co-commercialization agreement with Novartis covering UCB0599, a potential first in class, small molecule, alpha-synuclein misfolding inhibitor currently in Phase 2 clinical development, and upon completion of the ongoing Phase 1 program, an opt-in to co-develop UCB7853, an anti-alpha-synuclein antibody, both in Parkinson’s Disease (PD).

* In November 2021, Sio Gene Therapies Inc. provided a manufacturing and regulatory update for AXO-Lenti-PD, its clinical-stage gene therapy for Parkinson’s disease. Three GMP batches successfully completed fill and finish, achieving target titers using the updated suspension-based process

* In October 2021, Inhibikase Therapeutics announced the dosing of the first Parkinson’s patient in its Phase 1b clinical trial of IkT-148009, an Abelson Tyrosine Kinase, or c-Abl, an inhibitor for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease.

* In October 2021, AbbVie announced that continuous 24 hours/day subcutaneous infusion of ABBV-951 (foslevodopa/foscarbidopa) was statistically superior to oral levodopa/carbidopa in reducing motor fluctuations in patients with advanced Parkinson’s disease (PD) in a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled study. The study met its primary endpoint of increase from baseline in “On” time (hours) without troublesome dyskinesia (involuntary movements) after 12 weeks based on the Parkinson’s Disease Diary (PD Diary). These results will be a key component of global regulatory submissions.

Tavapadon was designed to improve motor symptoms in Parkinson’s disease by selectively targeting and binding to dopamine D1/D5 receptor subtypes. Tavapadon differentially activates the direct motor pathway, potentially driving motor benefit while minimizing side effects typical of drugs that non-selectively stimulate dopamine, such as daytime sedation, or somnolence, compromised impulse control and risk of psychotic symptoms including hallucinations. Tavapadon is also designed to activate the D1/D5 receptor subtypes at levels that maximize motor benefit while reducing the prolonged receptor overexcitation and desensitization caused by full agonists, which can lead to dyskinesias and exacerbation of “off” time. Currently, it is in Phase III stage of clinical trial evaluation to treat Parkinson disease.

PT320 is a sustained-release Exenatide (GLP1 agonist) for biweekly injection (Q2W). Due to its short half-life of 2.4 hours in the plasma of Exenatide, Peptron has developed a long-acting SR-Exenatide (PT320), resulting in sustained elevations of Exenatide for 20 days. With the result of preclinical and Phase I study of PT320, Peptron is testing the efficacy of PT320 of Parkinson’s disease in the on-going Phase II trial.

Inhibikase Therapeutics’ lead product candidate, IkT-148009, is a potent, selective small-molecule medication designed and engineered as chronically administered, once-daily oral medication targeting the underlying biological mechanism resulting in Parkinson’s disease, with the goal of halting disease progression and reversing functional loss. IkT-148009 is designed to block the activation of Abl kinase, a clinically validated drug target, to halt and reverse the loss of dopamine-secreting neurons in the brain and GI tract by restoring neuroprotective mechanisms.

NLY01 is a proprietary long-acting analogue of exendin-4, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonist. NLY01 penetrates the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in animal models and its receptor (GLP-1R) is highly expressed on glial cells. NLY01 is being developed as a disease-modifying agent for neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease. In clinically relevant animal models, NLY01 was found to prevent neuronal cell death by inhibition of microglial activation and formation of A1 neurotoxic astroglial cells. Treatment with NLY01 slowed disease progression, improved motor and cognitive functions and extended the lifespan in mice with Parkinson’s disease.

There are approx. 140+ key Parkinson’s Disease companies which are developing the therapies. The companies which have their Parkinson’s disease drug candidates in the most advanced stage, i.e. phase III include, Cerevel Therapeutics.
