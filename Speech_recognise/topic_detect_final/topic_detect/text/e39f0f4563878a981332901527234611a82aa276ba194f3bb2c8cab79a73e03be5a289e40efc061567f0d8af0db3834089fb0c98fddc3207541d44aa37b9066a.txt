Los Toros is a 5×3 reel slot with 243-ways to win and a maximum win of up to x2,093 the player’s bet.

Low value symbols are depicted as playing card suits, with diamonds, clubs, spades and hearts. If the right amount of matching combinations land on a single spin, these symbols can offer between x0.2 and x1.5 the player’s stake.

Next up, tomatoes, scrolls, coins, trophies and matadors depict the high value symbols, offering between x0.5 and x4 the player’s preferred bet.

Wild text symbols are available on reels two, three, four and five, substituting for all symbols other than the scatter and bull bonus symbols.

Landing six or more bull bonus symbols on the same spin will trigger the bonus game mode.

Finally, bull horn balance scatters can appear on reels one, three and five, triggering 10 free spins if three land on the same turn.

During the free spins feature, wilds can appear with multipliers of x2 and x3 values that will be applied to any wins that the wilds contribute to.

In the bonus bull game mode, players are taken to an empty reel set where only the triggering bull symbols are displayed. Players are given three spins to land as many bulls on the board as possible, with each bull resetting the number of spins to three.

Landing a certain number of bulls when the feature finishes will award a respective prize, ranging from x1 for six bulls and x1,000 for filling the reel set with 15 bulls.

Additionally, the jackpot game mode can be randomly triggered at the end of any base game spin, with players tasked with selecting several boxes with hidden jackpot diamonds behind them.

Once players have selected four identical jackpot diamonds, they will be awarded their respective prizes.

Furthermore, players can buy access to the free spins feature for the price of x100 their stake.
