The Australian luggage brand July has opened

a brand new flagship store in Melbourne’s QV Centre.

Designed by architect Ewert Leaf and builders Trust Projects – who created the famous pastry brand Lune Croissanterie stores – the flagship references “the golden era of travel”. The store stocks the brand’s colourful, functional range of luggage and bags along with travel accessories and offers personalisation design service in-store.

Athan Didaskalou, Co-Founder of July, said the vision for the store was to create a space that was both memorable and functional. “Our products have been designed to make travelling as easy and hassle-free as possible. Our store is the perfect environment for travellers to see and experience our products first-hand.”

Ana Calic, Director at Ewert Leaf, said the design team “explored and unpacked the idea of how it feels to be on holiday” and translated it into a physical space.
