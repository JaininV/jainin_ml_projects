Let's all give a hearty clap for Lainey Wilson, who is celebrating a major achievement in the world of country music.

Just a few weeks after winning at the 2023 CMT Awards, the Yellowstone star may be in line for a whole new set of trophies. On April 13, the 2023 Academy of Country Music (ACM) Awards announced that Lainey garnered six nominations ahead of the May 11 ceremony. Among the huge nods she received was Female Artist of the Year (alongside Kelsea Ballerini and Miranda Lambert), Album of the Year for her LP Bell Bottom Country and Single of the Year for her song "Heart Like a Truck."

Shortly after the news broke about Lainey's incredible milestone, she took to Instagram to share her gratitude for the acknowledgement. "Woke up this morning to this and y’all … this never gets old," she captioned the post.

She continued: "Thank you to every single person who has made this possible. I am so proud to be in these categories alongside some of my favorite artists and friends ... Love y’all and see y’all down in TX. Let’s go!!!"

When Yellowstone fans learned of Lainey's latest career accolades, they flooded her Instagram to rejoice over the news. In the midst of congratulatory words, they all agreed the artist deserved all the acclaim she receives.

"Yes!!! Can I get a come on, let’s go!!!! 🔥," one person wrote in the comments section. "So happy for you! Thanks for giving us great music and bell bottoms 😍," another added. "👏👏 Well deserved 👏👏," a different follower exclaimed.

While Lainey's music career continues to hit a home run, her status on Yellowstone remains a mystery. At the moment, it's unclear when filming will begin for season 5 part 2. What's more, she admitted that she doesn't know if will be rejoining the Paramount Network cast.

"I haven't got a call yet," Lainey told Entertainment Tonight earlier this month. "But as far as I know they don't even know when they're going to be filming."

Still, something tells us that her presence in the country music world will only keep soaring!
