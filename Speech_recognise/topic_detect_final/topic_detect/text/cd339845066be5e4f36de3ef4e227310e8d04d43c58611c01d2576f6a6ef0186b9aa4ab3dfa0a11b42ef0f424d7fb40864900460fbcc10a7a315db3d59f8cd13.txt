If you're a hamburger lover then you've probably tried your hand at making them at home, especially if you're entertaining or hosting a barbecue. Not only are burgers easy and fun for guests to assemble themselves, but you can control every step of their construction from the quality of meat you're using and how much fat is in the blend to the temperature of your grill and how your burger is cooked. It's a simple process, but that means a small choice like using too low of heat can actually be big mistake.

When cooking beef burgers, many people are concerned about over-cooking the meat. After all, while chicken and turkey burgers must be cooked all the way through for safety, beef burgers can safely be eaten cooked medium at 160 degrees Fahrenheit. If you're aiming for a burger that's still pink in the middle you might find yourself wanting to back off the heat, but that's the exact opposite of what you should do. Whether you cook burgers on the grill, on the flat top, or in a pan, caramelizing the meat is the name of the game. And the only way to get a nice caramelization on your meat is to use high heat.
