New research shows how the British public are using the power of digital tools to help navigate the rising cost of living, with 85 percent of adults saying that is has never been more important to be ‘financially savvy’.

All generations have been found to be embracing online and app based tools to help navigate the rising cost of living, with three-quarters of adults saying that digital tools help them keep tabs on their finances.

The research suggests that Gen Z – those born from 1997 – are the most ‘financially savvy’ as they are more likely to pay into multiple pension schemes or bump up their monthly savings when they get a pay rise. The poll of 2,000 adults also found that millennials – those born between 1981 to 1996 – are most likely to regularly monitor their credit score or overpay their mortgage when they get more cash.
