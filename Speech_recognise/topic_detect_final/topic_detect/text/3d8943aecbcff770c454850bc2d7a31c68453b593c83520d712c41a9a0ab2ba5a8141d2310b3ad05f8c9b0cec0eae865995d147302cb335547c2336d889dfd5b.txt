From Michelin-starred restaurants to the Times Square McDonald's — where customers' weird orders have been exposed on the big screen — New York seems to encompass all elements of our country's dining scene. But in a place where diners can find homestyle food from cultures around the world with just a quick subway ride, certain favorites from even within the U. S. are off-limits.

If there's one restaurant that seems suited to New York life, it's Waffle House: Open all hours of the day, cheap, quick, and nostalgic. The 24/7 diner started as a small shop in Atlanta and now has about 2,000 locations in 26 states — but there are plenty of states you'll never find a Waffle House, and New York is one of them.

Other Southern food chains have triumphantly arrived in the Empire State. Bojangles, for example, is expanding rapidly around the country and, as New York country radio station WRYK put it, is now "finally" coming to New York. And Manhattan is home to one of the world's largest Chick-fil-A locations, complete with a rooftop terrace.

So why hasn't Waffle House expanded to New York, too? There are a couple of reasons why the chain might be staying out of the Big Apple, and they all have to do with money.
