Police said the banner sought to portray Atiq and his brother as “martyrs”. It also had a newspaper cutting that abused a particular community for the murder of the two brothers last week.

Police registered a case against three persons under Indian Penal Code sections 294 (obscenity by words or utterances), 295 (outraging religious feelings) and 153 (A) (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth) and arrested the trio, he said.

Apart from this, a first information report (FIR) was also registered against the editor and a reporter of the newspaper whose report was used on the banner, he said. Atiq Ahmed-Ashraf Ahmed Killings: Supreme Court To Hear on April 24 Plea Seeking Independent Probe Into Murder of Gangster-Turned-Politician and His Brother.
