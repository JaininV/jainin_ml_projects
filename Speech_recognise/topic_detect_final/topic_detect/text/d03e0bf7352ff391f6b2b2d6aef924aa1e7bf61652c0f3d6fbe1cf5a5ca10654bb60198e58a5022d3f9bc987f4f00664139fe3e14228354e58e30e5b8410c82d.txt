A coalition of agriculture and conservation organizations is asking Congress to fund at least $1.2 billion for USDA Conservation Operations in fiscal year 2024.

The coalition is also requesting lawmakers support full farm bill funding for conservation programs.

National Association of Conservation Districts President Kim LaFleur tells Brownfield nearly 90 percent of the funds are used for conservation technical assistance through the Natural Resources Conservation Service.

“It is a substantial increase, but we feel it’s needed to help NRCS address the huge backlog and the demand for NRCS conservation programs,” she says.
