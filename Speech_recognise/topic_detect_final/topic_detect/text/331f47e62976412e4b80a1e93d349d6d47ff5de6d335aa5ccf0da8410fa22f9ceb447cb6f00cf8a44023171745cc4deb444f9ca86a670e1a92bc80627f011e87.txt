Price is in a prime area to move to the downside. We have price breaking above the high at the 135.113 area  with an ascending channel and now we just need to wait for a solid impulse to the downside on the 1h timeframe, followed by a 15m flag continuation for a reduced risk entry. There is a possibility that price comes back up to fill the wick / convince more traders that price is going to the upside to collect more orders before we get the momentum to the downside. USD/JPY has a mind of its own and pretty much ignores what the DXY does and gives really good continuations when price is committing. I plan on milking this trade with multiple scale ins.
