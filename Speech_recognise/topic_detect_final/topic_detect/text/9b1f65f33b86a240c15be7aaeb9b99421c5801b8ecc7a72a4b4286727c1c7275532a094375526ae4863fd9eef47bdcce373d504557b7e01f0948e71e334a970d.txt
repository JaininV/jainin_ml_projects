Following a public consultation and survey process, Maple View Public School has been selected by the Near North District School Board as the name of its new public elementary school on Norman Street.

The survey data indicated that Maple View Public School was the top choice. The other finalists were Trout Lake Public School and Graniteville Public School.

The new public JK-6 school will bring together the students of E. W. Norman and E.T. Carmichael, is located on the former W.J. Fricker property, and is set to open in September.

According to the process outlined by the naming committee, the top name was to be the one forwarded to the NNDSB Board. The trustees accepted the naming committee’s recommendation to select Maple View Public School as the new school's name. The decision was made during Tuesday's board of trustees meeting.

NNDSB says it was the culmination of several months of work by the committee, which oversaw multiple opportunities for public consultation. The public was invited to submit a name and rationale in one survey period. After that, the committee created a shortlist of three names, which were included in a survey for voting by the public.

NNDSB has said the most common theme from the many suggestions received was the "wish to convey the natural beauty of the geography, which is special to this area. The new school is located near the life source of North Bay known as Trout Lake."
