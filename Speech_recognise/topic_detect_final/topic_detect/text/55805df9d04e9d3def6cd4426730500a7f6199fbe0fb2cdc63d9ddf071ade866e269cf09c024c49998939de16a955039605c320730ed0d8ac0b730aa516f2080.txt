As you may recall, Aziz Ansari was supposed to make his directorial debut last year with a film titled Being Mortal. That film was suspended a year ago, following sexual assault allegations against Bill Murray.

Today, it was announced that Ansari will be directing another film, that he also wrote, titled Good Fortune. That film – which we currently don’t know the plot for – is not based on the previous project. That being said, one of the stars from Being Mortal Seth Rogen, will star in Good Fortune. Also starring is Keanu Reeves and Ansari himself.

Ansari will also write the script, and the film will be produced by Anthony Katagas, Alan Yang, and Lionsgate.

Motion Picture Group head Joe Drake said, “We have indeed found good fortune with this film. We love the script and believe strongly in Aziz as both a performer and a director. And when you add in Seth and Keanu — two incredible world-class talents — toplining alongside Aziz, this has the potential to be a very special film for us. We moved quickly to land this project once it was available.”
