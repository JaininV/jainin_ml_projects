(1888PressRelease) April 19, 2023 - Dubai has always been at the forefront of innovation and technological advancements, and the city is once again making waves in the world of finance by combining digital gold with blockchain technology. Introducing crypto gold is a game-changing move to revolutionize the gold market, and Dubai is leading the way. Buying and selling gold has been a tried-and-true trade and investment staple for centuries. Investors in Dubai can now buy gold as a digital asset due to the launch of a groundbreaking blockchain network.

The DMCC free zone has partnered with Comtech Gold to digitize the buying and selling of gold by tokenizing the precious metal. This innovative approach allows for gold to be backed by physical gold bars registered on DMCC Trade flow, bringing unprecedented transparency and efficiency to the gold market. With the ability to trade digital gold, investors in Dubai can now access an unparalleled level of flexibility and convenience in their precious metal investments.

From Physical To Digital: The Future Of Gold Trading In Dubai

DMCC Tradeflow is a cutting-edge online platform in the UAE, enabling hassle-free registration of commodity ownership stored in top-tier facilities. Investors can own as small as a single gram of precious metals, even though their asset remains secure within the vault. Comtech Gold Tokens are powered by the XinFin Protocol blockchain network and supported by physical gold bars stored in DMCC-approved vaults. Every gold bar is backed by a Tradeflow warrant, providing a seamless and secure trading experience for tokenized assets. With this combination, investors can enjoy the additional transparency, security, and real-asset allocation provided by the Tradeflow warrant.
