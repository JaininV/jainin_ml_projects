Posting these up for sale as I recently swapped out my OEM front seats. These are a pair of original N55 F87 M2 front seats in black with polar blue stitching. These seats have 40k miles on them, have always been well maintained with Chemical Guys products, and are in great condition. These seats are ready to go and only require you to transfer over your OEM seat belt retainer and OEM seat module. Airbags are included and in full working order! Located in Los Angeles and not looking to ship at the moment. PM or respond to the thread if you have any questions! These would be an awesome upgrade for any E9X owners and will fit with minimal work! The price is OBO - not really sure what these would go for so make me an offer!
