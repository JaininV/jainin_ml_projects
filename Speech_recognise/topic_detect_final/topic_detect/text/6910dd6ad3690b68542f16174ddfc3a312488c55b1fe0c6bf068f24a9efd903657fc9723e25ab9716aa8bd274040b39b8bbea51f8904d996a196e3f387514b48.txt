A Springfield museum devoted to telling the story of the Black experience locally has hired its first executive director.

Volunteers had entirely run the Springfield and Central Illinois African American History Museum. But a grant from the Federal Institute of Museum and Library Services will underwrite the salary for new executive director Nalo Mitchell – who started there on April 1.

She had been the director of community and family engagement for District 186 before taking on the museum role.

The museum, which seeks to tell “authentic stories” about African American life in Central Illinois, is located on Monument Avenue next to the entrance to Oak Ridge Cemetery.
