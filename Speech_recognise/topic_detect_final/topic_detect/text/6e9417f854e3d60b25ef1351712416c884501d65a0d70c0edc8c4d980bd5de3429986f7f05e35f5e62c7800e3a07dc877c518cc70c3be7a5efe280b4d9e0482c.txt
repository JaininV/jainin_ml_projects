Our Lone Star story of the day: Big issues before the 88th Regular Texas Legislature include property tax relief; public school choice; energy policy, and; court mandated reform of the Texas foster care system.

Today’s show orginates from the Texas Public Policy Foundation and I talk with James Quintero about the competing property tax relief plans from the Senate and the House; former state Rep. Jason Isaac about the Left’s attack on plentiful energy; Mandy Drogin on parental empowerment and school choice, and; Andrew Brown on the progress on reform of the foster care system.
