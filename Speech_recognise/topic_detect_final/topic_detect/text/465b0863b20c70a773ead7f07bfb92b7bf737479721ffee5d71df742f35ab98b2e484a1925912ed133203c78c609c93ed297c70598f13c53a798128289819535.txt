Fashion icon Katie Holmes, 44, came under fire at the end of last year for her dress and jeans ensemble inspired by early 2000s trends.

Katie donned a navy blue strapless mini dress with light blue jeans and black trainers, leaving her brunette locks down for the event with the lightest dash of makeup enhancing her natural beauty.

The double-denim coloured outfit was torn apart by fashion critics and fans as Katie attended the Madison Square Garden Jingle Ball -  a lavish and well-photographed event.

Speaking to Glamour Magazine, she described the backlash to her noughties-inspired look as “powerful language”, but revealed that she was actually wearing a bustier, not a mini dress and without the jeans the outfit would have been outrageously inappropriate.

She added: “Let’s look a little bit past what we’re wearing. That’s our duty amongst each other. I feel like the woman’s journey is deeper.”
