SEOUL, April 19 (Korea Bizwire) —Shinsegae Food plans to launch a 100% plant-based burger named the “Better Burger” next month at its No Brand Burger stores. The burger will use alternative meat, cheese, and buns made from plant-based proteins, including soybeans and cashew nuts, without using animal ingredients such as milk and eggs. Shinsegae will switch to plant-based buns for all 213 No Brand Burger stores from April 20.

The company has been researching and developing alternative meats since 2016, and the plant-based food business is an area of focus for the company’s Vice Chairman. The global alternative meat market is expected to grow from $8.7 billion (11.53 trillion won) this year to $11 billion in 2025.
