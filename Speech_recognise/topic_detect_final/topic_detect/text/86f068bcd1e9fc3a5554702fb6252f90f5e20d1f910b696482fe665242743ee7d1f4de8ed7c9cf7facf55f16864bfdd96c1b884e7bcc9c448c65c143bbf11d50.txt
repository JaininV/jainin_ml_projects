“Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Pipeline Insight, 2023“ report by DelveInsight outlines comprehensive insights into the present clinical development scenario and growth prospects across the Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Market.

Some of the key takeaways from the Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Pipeline Report:

* Companies across the globe are diligently working toward developing novel Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma treatment therapies with a considerable amount of success over the years.

* Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma companies working in the treatment market are Elicio Therapeutics, General Oncology, Inc., Revolution Medicines, Amplia Therapeutics, ZielBio, Lisata Therapeutics, Inc., Cardiff Oncology, Eucure Biopharma, Panbela Therapeutics, Inc., Jiangsu Alphamab Biopharmaceuticals, Novartis Pharmaceuticals, Cantargia, Eucure Biopharma, Arcus Biosciences, Syntrix Biosystems, and others, are developing therapies for the Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma treatment

* Emerging Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma therapies such as – ELI-002, Melphalan, RMC-6236, AMP 945, ZB131, CEND-1, Onvansertib, YH003, SBP-101, KN046, NIS793, Nadunolimab, YH 003, Zimberelimab, SX 682, and others are expected to have a significant impact on the Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma market in the coming years.

* In January 2022, In order to compare the effectiveness and safety of KN046 combined with Gemcitabine and Nab-Paclitaxel versus placebo combined with Gemcitabine and Nab-Paclitaxel in first-line Advanced Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma subjects (ENREACH-PDAC-01), Jiangsu Alphamab Biopharmaceuticals started a multicenter, randomized, double-blind Phase III study

* In July 2022, Cend Therapeutics, Inc. reported that data from the Phase 1b study of CEND-1, Cend’s lead investigational drug, in combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel for the treatment of first-line, metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (“mPDAC”) were published in The Lancet Gastroenterology and Hepatology

* In July 2022, I-Mab reported that a Phase 1 international multi-center clinical trial (IMCT) for patients with solid tumours, such as gastric cancer, gastroesophageal junction carcinoma, esophageal adenocarcinoma, and pancreatic ductal carcinoma, has treated the first patient in China with TJ-CD4B (also known as ABL111), a novel Claudin 18.2 x 4-1BB bispecific antibody

* In June 2022, The mRNA-based personalized neoantigen-specific immunotherapy (iNeST) autogene cevumeran (also known as BNT122, RO7198457) in combination with the anti-PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitor atezolizumab and chemotherapy in patients with resected pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) was recently evaluated for safety and tolerability in a first-in-human Phase 1 study. It was confirmed that the method of tumour profiling for individualized vaccine design and on-demand production of iNeST in a therapeutically appropriate period is feasible. The early findings revealed a good safety profile and encouraging hints of clinical activity

* In June 2022, In order to move Motixafortide through a randomized Phase 2b clinical trial in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, or PDAC, BioLineRx Ltd. stated that the firm had entered into a collaboration agreement with GenFleet Therapeutics, an immuno-oncology-focused biopharmaceutical firm with headquarters in China

* In November 2021, Alphamab Oncology announced that the IND application for phase III registration study(KN046-303) of the PD-L1/CTLA-4 bispecific antibody KN046 plus nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine for the treatment of advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) was approved by the Center for Drug Evaluation (CDE) of the NMPA

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly aggressive lethal malignancy due to the lack of early diagnosis and limited response to treatments. It is the most prevalent type of pancreatic neoplasm, and it is developed in the exocrine compartment and accounts for more than 90% of pancreatic cancer cases.
