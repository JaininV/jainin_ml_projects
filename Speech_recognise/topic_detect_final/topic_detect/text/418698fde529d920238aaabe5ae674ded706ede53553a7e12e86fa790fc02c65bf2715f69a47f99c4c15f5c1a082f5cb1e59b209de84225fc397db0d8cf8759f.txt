Xtra Time Web Desk: Cricket Australia National Selection Panel (NSP) has named a 17-player men’s squad for the Tour of England, encompassing the ICC World Test Championship final 2023 against India and opening two Ashes Tests.

Australia plays India at The Oval in the ICC World Test Championship final followed by Ashes Tests at Edgbaston, Lord’s, Headingly, Old Trafford, and The Oval.

The NSP will evaluate the performance of squad following the first three matches. A 15-player squad for the ICC World Test Championship will be named on May 28.

Marcus Harris, Josh Inglis and Mitchell Marsh have been recalled while Ashton Agar, Peter Handscomb, Mitchell Swepson and Matt Kuhnemann were not retained from the squad which toured India. Lance Morris has been ruled out of the squad with injury.

NSP Chair of Selectors George Bailey said: “The World Test Championship is the culmination of more than two years of consistent performance at Test level by the team and the individuals involved, leading into an Ashes series which is always highly anticipated.

“The UK is a very different assignment from our most recent tour of India and some of the changes are based upon the conditions we are anticipating.

“Marcus, Josh and Mitch return to the squad and provide valuable depth and flexibility within their respective skillsets.

“We see value in revisiting the squad following the second Ashes Test given the short turnaround between the WTC final and the first Ashes Test, along with the length of the tour.”

Australian squad for WTC Final and first two Ashes tests:

Australia plays India in the World Test Championship at the Oval from June 7-11 before moving to the first Ashes Test against England at Edgbaston from June 16-20.
