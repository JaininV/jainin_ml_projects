Of the four races for School Board this year, only one is contested, and whoever wins will be a first-time officeholder – incumbent Tina Baker has declined to seek reelection. The contestants are Chris Hawkins and Steven Castellano, and on Monday, April 17, we hosted them both for a debate covering a wide range of issues – the video is available below.

Ballots will arrive in late April, and are due on May 16.

This school board election comes at a time that is fraught for both students and teachers in Corvallis.

As an example of the differences between the candidates:

Castellano states, “Oregon schools rank 48th in the nation and Corvallis schools should lead the way in improving that number.” He contends schools need more funding and that teacher salaries should be increased.

Hawkins says, that if elected, she will prioritize “all students, including those with unique physical, emotional and social needs.”  She also believes the district should expand its vocational programs.

This forum was moderated by former City Club vice-president Helen Higgins, who in years past served on the school board, and is currently the executive director of the Boys & Girls Club of Corvallis.
