Glastonbury Festival organisers have revealed the dates for the 2023 ticket resale, with a slight change versus previous years.

Unveiling the details on their website earlier today (April 12th), organisers have confirmed a limited run of tickets will become available on Thursday 20th April (for tickets + coach combo), and Sunday 23rd April for general admission tickets.

However, unlike previous years, organisers have revealed that customers will NOT be asked for payment details during the booking process. The official Glastonbury website details: “Once you have submitted your order request, including the registration details for each ticket, you will receive an initial confirmation to let you know we have received your order, followed by an email within 3 hours of the sale closing, with details of how to pay for the booking. You will then have 24 hours to complete your purchase, before the order is cancelled.”

As per all ticket sales, everyone would need to be registered in order to apply – the tickets will also only be available via Glastonbury’s official partner, SeeTickets. A maximum of two tickets can be booked at any one time in the coach resale; whereas general admission will allow a maximum of four tickets.
