Yahoo, made theese for a comission and though on sharing it with you guys!

They are scaled for an 153cm tall person, use that as the baseline.

You can print and paint the stars or make a silicon mold and cast them with some resin. If you're planning to make the mold I included an outter wall you can print and pour the silicone onto it, it's designed to use very little silicone, 20g should be enough.

You will need around 2g for each star. The rabbit pin has cuts on the back side so you can glue them nice and flat.
